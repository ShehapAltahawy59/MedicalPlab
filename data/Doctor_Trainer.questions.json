With unopposed plantarflexion, their foot drops.\nThere are two main reasons why the deep fibular nerve could be compressed.\n• The first is that the anterior leg muscles have been excessively used and so are\ncompressing the nerve with the anterior compartment. The patient will experience\npain in the anterior leg.\n• The other common cause is tight-fitting shoes, compressing the nerve beneath the\nextensor retinaculum.

Her medical history includes hypertension and\nheavy smoking. Ophthalmic assessment showed visual acuity of light perception\nonly in the right eye and 6/9 in the left eye.

  "choice_b": "Anterior cerebral artery",
  "choice_c": "Middle cerebral artery",
  "choice_d": "Central retinal artery",
  "choice_e": "Posterior inferior cerebellar artery",
  "answer": "Central retinal artery",
  "explanation": "Patients with central retinal artery occlusion have sudden painless loss of vision, usually\nwithin initial visual acuity of counting fingers or worse. Urgent management is required.\nThe short episodes of previous vision loss is termed amaurosis fugax. This temporary\npainless type of vision loss procees loss of vision in up to 10% of patients with central\nartery occlusion. Amaurosis fugax is usually caused by emboli coming from\natherosclerotic carotid artery resulting in a fleeting loss of vision when the emboli pass\nthrough the retinal circulation. Any temporary reduction in the retinal artery blood flow\nwould cause retinal hypoxia which includes any emboli arising from vasculature\npreceding the retinal artery.\nThe anatomy of the arterial supply of the eye is complicated. It is provided by several\nbranches of the ophthalmic artery, which derives from the internal carotid artery. These\nbranches include the central retinal artery, the short and long posterior ciliary arteries\nand the anterior ciliary arteries. The retina is mainly supplied by the central retinal\nartery and its branches which is a site of emboli.\nThe other arteries are less likely to be involved as they present with additional\nsymptoms.\n• Anterior and middle cerebral artery occlusions have features of contralateral\nhemiparesis and sensory loss.\n• Posterior inferior cerebellar artery has features of ipsilateral facial pain and\ntemperature loss, contralateral limb/torso pain and temperature loss, ataxia and\nnystagmus\n• Anterior communicating artery is a common site for brain aneurysms and if large\nenough to compress the optic chiasm visual defects such as bitemporal\nhemianopsia may occur\nKey points to remember\n• Amaurosis fugax is the temporary loss of vision due most commonly to ischaemia\n• Embolism is the most common cause of central retinal artery occlusion with the\nmajor source of this being atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery (as opposed\nto transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) involvind the cerebral hemispheres where\nemboli usually originates from heart disease instead of carotid stenosis)",

  "answer": "C7/T1",
  "explanation": "Hand weakness involves either median nerve which has contributions from C5-T1 or\nulnar nerve which originates from the C8-T1 nerve roots.\nRemember, a C8 vertebrae does not exist and so the option for C8/T1 is clearly wrong.\nThere are seven cervical vertebrae (C1-C7) and a total of eight cervical nerves C1-C8.\nAll cervical nerves except C8 emerge above their corresponding vertebrae, while the C8\nnerve emerges below the C7 vertebra that is between C7 and T1 vertebrae.\nWhen you request for a cervical X-ray for any severe injury of the neck, you would like\nthe film to extend up to C7/T1 as you would be able to see the cervical vertebrae (C1-\nC7). This applies for any trauma including road traffic accidents.\nThe patient should not try to move her neck and she should continue to have the\ncervical collar and immobilization of the neck until the cervical X-ray is performed to rule\nout cervical fractures.\nIn this case, there should be at least 3 X-ray views taken.\n• AP cervical spine view which shows the pedicles, facets and lateral masses\n• Lateral cervical spine view\n• Open-mouth odontoid view also called the peg view as would demonstrate peg\nfractures\nIn some cases where the patient’s neck is short, the X-ray film would not show the\nC7/T1 junction. The radiographsers would then ask for a swimmers lateral view. This\ninvolves repositioning the patient in such a way that the arm closest to the sensor is\nplaced above the patient’s head much like a swimming position. This would likely\nprovide a clear visualisation of C7/T1 junction. If again, this does not capture that\njunction, then we would need to request a CT scan to rule out fractures",

Note that the great or long saphenous vein travels on the medial aspect of the\nankle.\nThe left anterior descending (LAD, interventricular artery appears to be a direct\ncontinuation of the left coronary artery which descends into the anterior interventricular\ngroove.\nThe skin at the medial malleolus drains into inguinal lymph nodes.\nThe first lumbar vertebra is level with the anterior end of the ninth rib. This level is\nalso called the important transpyloric plane, since the pylorus of the stomach is at this\nlevel.\nThe deep inguinal ring is located about 2.5 cm above the midpoint of the inguinal\nligament.\nFull extension of right thumb is achieved by extensor pollicis longus\nThe fundus of the gall-bladder approaches the surface behind the anterior end of the\nninth right costal cartilage close to the lateral margin of the Rectus abdominis.\nThe extensor digitorum communis extends the phalages, then the wrist, and finally\nthe elbow. It tends to separate the fingers as it extends them.\nThe suprasternal notch (fossa jugularis sternalis) is also known as the jugular notch\nThe extensor pollicis brevis extends the thumb at the metacarpophalangeal joint.\nWhenever you see the word “foot drop” or “unable to dorsiflex: pick peroneal nerve.\nRadial nerve (C5-T1)\nMotor to\n• Extensor muscles (forearm, wrist, fingers, thumb)\n• If damaged – leads to wrist drop\nSensory to\n• If damaged – Sensory loss is variable, but always includes the dorsal aspect of\nthe root of the thumb. Usually leads to loss to small area between the dorsal aspect of\n1st and 2nd metacarpals.\nFacial nerve lesion leads to facial weakness and loss of taste sensation of anterior two\nthird of tongue.\nVagus nerve lesion results in weak cough, vocal cord paralysis with dysphonia. There\nis also parasympathetic loss of innervation to respiratory, gastrointestinal and\ncardiovascular systems.\nTrigeminal nerve lesion presents with signs depending upon the level of lesion.\nUsually there is weakness of muscles of mastication, jaw deviates to side of weak\npterygoid muscle and there is also loss of sensation on the face.\nGlossopharyngeal nerve lesion presents with loss of gag reflex, loss of taste\nsensation from posterior third of the tongue, loss of general sensation from posterior\npharynx, tonsils and soft palate.\nHypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve XII, and innervates muscles of the\ntongue.",

  "choice_b": "Diaphragm",
  "choice_c": "Intercostal artery",
  "choice_d": "Internal thoracic artery",
  "choice_e": "Liver",
  "answer": "Intercostal artery",
  "explanation": "When inserting a chest drain, one needs to be aware of the intercostal neurovascular\nbundle. This is located at the inferior aspects of the ribs.\nThe intercostal neurovascular bundle contains structures in a specific order which can\nbe remembered as “VAN”. This stands for\n• V – Vein\n• A – Artery\n• N – Nerve\nThis order is from top to bottom\nThe options in this question only have onf of the structures of the intercostal\nneurovascular bundle which is the intercostal artery. Hence that is the answer.\nHaving this knowledge of the location of the intercostal neurovascular bundle would\nhelp you remember to insert the needle directly above the upper margin of the relevant\nrib.\nChest drain Insertion technique\nChest insertion should be performed within the “safe triangle”\nIn the exam, it is important to remember the borders of the “Safe triangle” which is used\nin clinical practice for chest drain insertions. It is bounded anteriorly by pectoralis major,\nposteriorly by latissimus dorsi, inferiorly by the fifth intercostal space, and superiorly by\nthe axilla.\nBy inserting at the safe triangle, we avoid major vessels and muscles. It is important to\nnote that the intercostal vessels and nerves run below the inferior border of the ribs.\nThus, the drain track should be directed ove the top of the lower rib to avoid the\nintercostal vessels lying below each rib.",

He also has weakness of thumb extension and wrist ulnar deviation. There\nis wasting of the muscles of the left hand. What is the SINGLE most likely\nstructure affected?",
  "choice_a": "Ulnar nerve at elbow",
  "choice_b": "Median nerve at elbow",
  "choice_c": "Median nerve at wrist",
  "choice_d": "C8 nerve root",
  "choice_e": "T1 nerve root",
  "answer": "C8 nerve root",
  "explanation": "The C8 nerve root exits the spinal cord at the C7-T1 spinal segment. If the C8 nerve\nbecomes compressed or irritated for any reason, then C8 radiculopathy will occur.\nSymptoms of a C8 radiculopathy include weakness of thumb extension and wrist ulnar\ndeviation. Paresthesias in the little finger is also a finding in C8 radiculopathy. The test\nto perform to identify C8 radiculopathy is to have the patient hold their extended fingers\ntogether against the examiner’s attempts to open the fingers.\nIt is important in this question to differentiate between pure ulnar neuropathy and C8-T1\nradiculopathies. The ulnar nerve provides sensation to the fourth and fifth fingers and\nmedial border of the hand. The ulnar nerve innervates all intrinsic hand muscles,\nexcept the abductor and flexor pollicis brevis, opponens pllicis, and lateral two\nlumbricals, which are innervated by C8 and T1 via the median nerve. By examining\nthese five muscles, one can clinically differentiate cubital tunnel syndrome from C8-T1\nradiculopathies.\nThe ulnar nerve does not provide sensation to the medial forearm, which is innervated\nby the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve which is supplied by C8 and T1 via the\nmedial cord of the brachial plexus. Therefore, an ulnar lesion at the elbow which is a\ncommon site of compression or trauma would result in anaesthesia of the ulnar hand\nand fingers but not the forearm.",

Paraesthesiae and pain can also\noccur along the affected nerve.\nThe cervical spine is comprised of seven vertebrae only. A C8 vertebral injury is\nphysically impossible and hence cannot be the right answer. A C8 nerve root lesion\npresents with abnormalities of thumb movement primarily, as well as an ainablity to\nextend the elbow against resistance.\nT1 radiculopathy have similarities of clinical findings to C8 radiculopthy, so be thankful\nthat the option was C8 vertebral injury and not nerve root injury.\nThe ulnar nerve originates from the C8-T1 nerve roots. Ulnar nerve injury leads to the\nclassic ‘claw hand’ deformity. Since the ulnar nerve provides sensory innervation to the\nmedial side of the hand, fifth digit and the medial half of the fouth digit, injury to it will\ncause loss of sensation or paraesthesiae in those areas.\nA C6 lesion affects the sensation of the thumb, flexion of the elbow and rotation of the\nforearm. It usually occurs in conjunction with C5 injury. One may see this during\ndelivery of a baby which is known as Erb’s palsy.\nHere aree some easy points to remember regarding motor function for cervical roots\n• Flex elbow – C5\n• Extend wrist – C6\n• Extend elbow – C7\n• Flex fingers – C8\n• Adduct and abduct fingers – T1\nTry to do the above sequence like a strange dance to help you memorise it.",

  "choice_b": "Metoprolol",
  "choice_c": "Electrical cardioversion",
  "choice_d": "Amiodarone",
  "choice_e": "Digoxin",
  "answer": "Metoprolol",
  "explanation": "Rate control medications such as metoprolol should be given first as he is\nhemodynamically stable. If rate control medications fail, then we could try rhythm\ncontrol.\nDigoxin as part of rate control should not be used as first line unless there is evidence of\ncongestive heart failure.\nRemember, the most important part of management for atrial fibrillation is preventing\nstrokes and controlling patient’s symptoms. Converting patients back to sinus rhythm is\nnot always the main goal.\nAtrial fibrillation management\nThe clinical presentation of atrial fibrillation can vary. Some patients are asymptomatic;\nothers may have life-threatening complications (e.g. heart failure or angina). The\nmanagement depends on the underlying cause and the presence of symptoms.\nThere are two wide categories for management:\n1. Rhythm control (cardioversion)\n2. Rate control\nRhythm Control\nIf the patient has signs of shock, syncope, acute cardiac failure, or ischaemia then\nperform electrical cardioversion under sedation. This is rarely necessary. There is also\nthe option of chemically cardioverting with flecainide or amiodarone.\nIf the patient has had symptoms for more than 48 hours, there is a risk of cardiac\nthromboembolism when cardioverted. So in these cases, rate control medications and\nlow molecular weight heparin are better choices.\nRate control\nRate control medications include beta blockers (metoprolol), rate limiting calcium\nchannel blockers (diltiazem or verapamil) and digoxin.\nFor rate control, beta blockers or rate limiting calcium channel blockers are first choice.\nDigoxin 500 mcg is usually the choice of drug if the patient suffers from congestive heart\nfailure.\nExample of how rate control is performed:\n1. Either a beta-blocker (metoprolol 2.5 mg up to 5 mg IV over 5 min, which can be\nrepeated at intervals of 10 min to a maximum of 10 mg, or 50 mg orally) or a\nrate-limiting calcium blocker (verapamil 2.5 mg IV over 2 min, which can be\nrepeated at intervals of 5 min to a maximum of 10 mg) but not both\n2. If rate does not fall sufficiently, add digoxin\n3. Where heart failure is a clinical issue, start with digoxin.\n4. Also give thromboprophylaxis.\nPersistent AF is considered AF that is not self-terminating lasting longer than 7 days, or\nprior cardioversion.\nThis is a general idea of when we should use rhythm control and rate control.\nFactors towards rhythm control first for patients with persistent AF\n• Who are symptomatic\n• Who are younger\n• Presenting for the first time with lone AF\nFactors towards rate-control first for patients with persistent AF:\n• Over 65\n• If patient is stable and AF started more than 48 hours ago\n• Who are unstable for cardioversion such as\no A long history of AF (usually > 12 months)\no A history of multiple failed attempts at cardioversion and/or relapses",

  "choice_e": "Low molecular weight heparin",
  "answer": "Warfarin",
  "explanation": "The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. The symptoms of stroke were probably due to\natrial fibrillation.\nThe main goals in managing AF are rate/rhythm control and anticoagulation. As she was already\nmanaged with metoprolol which is a rate limiting medication, the next step is to count her CHA DS -VASc\n2 2\nscore to determine if she requires anticoagulation. In her case, she would have a CHA DS -VASc score\n2 2\nof 4 (1 for hypertension, 1 for age, 1 for stroke history and 1 for sex). Anticoagulation such as warfarin\nwould be of benefit to reduce the risk of stroke for her.\nAspirin is no longer used for stroke prevention.\nATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND ANTICOAGULATION, CHA DS -VASc\n2 2\nNICE suggest using the CHA DS -VASc score to determine the most appropriate anticoagulation strategy\n2 2\nfor atrial fibrillation. The CHA DS -VASc score is used to assess a patient’s stroke risk. Offer\n2 2\nanticoagulation to all people with a CHA DS -VASc of 2 or above, and consider offering it to men with a\n2 2\nCHA DS -VASc of 1.\n2 2\nIn practice, the HAS-BLED score is also usually calculated to identify patients at high risk of bleeding who\ncould benefit from increased vigilance and a specific focus on correction of modifiable risk factors. The\ndecision to start treatment with an anticoagulant should invole consideration of a balance between the\nbenefits in stroke reduction, the adverse effects of increasing bleeding risk, and particularly risk of\nhaemorrhagic stroke.\nRisk factor Points\nC Congestive heart failure 1\nH Hypertension (or treated hypertension) 1\nA2 Age ≥ 75 years 2\nAge 65-74 years 1\nD Diabetes 1\nS2 Prior stroke or TIA 2\nV Vascular disease (including ischaemic heart disease and peripheral 1\narterial disease)\nS Sex (female) 1\nFor the purpose of the exam (and only for the exam), we have tried to simplify this. It may be quicker to\nremember when to give warfarin according to the below scenarios instead of writing out and calculating\nthe whole CHA DS -VASc score. This only applies to simple exam scenarios.\n2 2\n• < 65 years old and no comorbidies → No warfarin\n• ≥ 65 years old or at least one comorbidity → warfarin\nAnother alternative to warfarin which has gained much popularity over the past decade are DOAC (Direct-\nActing Oral Anticoagulants) such as apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban. These medications are also\nlicensed for use for stroke prevention with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a CHA DS -VASc score ≥ 2\n2 2\n(consider for men with CHA DS -VASc score ≥ 1).\n2 2\nThe benefits of using DOAC compared to warfarin include:\n• Reduces the risk of intracranial haemorrhage\n• No INR monitoring\n• Faster onset anticoagulation (2-4 hours)\nThe disadvantages of using DOAC compared to warfarin include:\n• No specific antidote\n• Essential to be compliant\nNewer questions for the exam may contain DOAC as an option so do read up on them.\nSECONDARY PREVENTION AFTER STROKE OR TIA\nStroke: A syndrome of the sudden onset of focal neurological loss of presumed vascular origin lasting\nmore than 24 hours\nTransient Ischaemic Attack: A syndrome of the sudden onset of focal neurological loss of presumed\nvascular origin lasting less than 24 hours.\nThe following are important notes to remember as part of secondary prevention in stroke or TIA\nonce it is confirmed:\n• Lower BP\no Aim for target Blood Pressure of 130/80\n▪ Note: Do not start controlling BP in first 48 hours as this may cause extension of stroke\no Age ≥ 55 or black patient of any age start a calcium channel blocker\no Age > 55 start ACE inhibitor or Angiotensin-(II) receptor antagonists if ACE inhibitor not\ntolerated\no Add ACE inhibitor, calcium channel antagonist, or thiazide diuretc if target not achieved with\ninitial choice\n▪ Note: BP management for secondary prevention in stroke and TIA is unlikely to be\nasked during the exam as SIGN and NICE guidelines differ slightly. SIGN recommends\nusing thiazides and ACE inhibitors in all, even if normotensive.\n• Lower Cholesterol\no Aim for 40% reduction in non-HDL cholesterol\no Statins to be taken daily lifelong after TIA or ischaemic stroke\n▪ Note: Statins for all regardless of baseline cholesterol\n▪ 80 mg atorvastatin recommended by both NICE and SIGN\n• Use antiplatelet or anticoagulation treatment in ischaemic stroke/TIA\no This largely depends if atrial fibrillation is present\no Atrial fibrillation present:\n▪ Use an anticoagulation: Warfarin, Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, Edoxaban\n(Warfarin target INR range 2.0-3.0\n• Note: In the acute setting:\no If TIA and imaging has excluded haemorrhage, start anticoagulation\nimmediately\no If disabling ischaemic stroke, defer anticoagulation treatment for 14 days from\nonset. In the interim, aspirin 300 mg daily can be used.\no Atrial fibrillation absent:\n▪ Give clopidogrel 75 mg OD for long-term prevention of ischaemic events\n• If intolerant of clopidogrel, give aspirin 75 mg OD plus dipyridamole MR 200 mg BD\no And again if this is not tolerated use either aspirin or dipyridamole alone\n▪ Note: For acute treatment of ischaemic stroke give 300 mg of Aspirin for 2 weeks\n• Lifestyle advice\no Low salt diet\no Low cholesterol diet\no Weight loss\no Alcohol reduction\no Smoking cessation\nLastly, always consider carotid endarterectomy as secondary prevention in ischaemic stroke\n• Carotid duplex is done as part of workup at TIA clinic to consider carotid endarterectomy if\ninternal carotid artery is stenosed (stenosis is ≥ 50% in men, ≥ in women)\no Guidelines recommend this should eb done within 2 weeks of admission (SIGN & NICE)\nSpecial key notes from SIGN Guidelines regarding secondary prevention after haemorrhagic\nstrokes:\n• BP control is important\n• Do not offer antiplatelets, unless at high risk of a cardiac event\n• Statins are not recommended",

They can also make some blood pressure-lowering medicines, such as ACE inhibitors and\ndiuretics, less effective – and a rise in blood pressure is likely to worsen heart failure.\nIt is also worth noting that thiazide diuretics increase the risk of gout due to reduced clearance of uric\nacid.",

  "explanation": "For junior doctors, the ECG pattern between ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation can be\nrather hard to distinguish. But here as the patient is still conscious, it cannot be ventricular fibrillation as v.\nfib would present without a pulse and the patient would not be conscious. Thus, ventricular tachycardia is\nthe answer here.\nSince the patient is haemodynamically unstable, cardioversion would be the answer.\nVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA:\nVentricular tachycardia may impair cardiac output with consequent hypotension, collapse, and acute\ncardiac failure. This is due to extreme heart rates and lack of coordinated atrial contraction (loss of “atrial\nkick”).\nThe rate of V. Tach is from about 100-250 bpm. P Waves may be present or absent. P waves are usually\nnot seen if the rate is increased. If present, the P Waves have no relation to the QRS complexes of the V.\nTach.\nV. tach can present in two ways:\n1. With Pulse\nHaemodynamically stable or\nHaemodynamically unstable — e.g hypotension, chest pain, cardiac failure, decreased conscious level.\n2. Without Pulse\nManagement depends on how the patient presents:\nWith Pulse:\nHaemodynamically stable → antiarrhythmics e.g. amiodarone, lidocaine, procainamide\nHaemodynamically unstable — e.g hypotension, chest pain, cardiac failure, decreased conscious level.\n→ immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated\nWithout Pulse → immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated\nECG ARRHYTHMIA CLINCHERS\nCLINCHERS ONLY TO BE USED FOR EXAM PURPOSES\nThese clinchers help point you towards an answer but you would still need to read the whole stem and\nlook at the ECG before making up your mind.

There is usually a period of post-ictal drowsiness or confusion if a seizure was to be\nconsidered. This stem mentions that he recovered completely within a few minutes which tells us that\nseizure is unlikely.\nCardiac syncopal events are the most likely here as they are usually abrupt in onset with rapid recovery\nwith flushing. This is the reason that ECG is the answer here.\nIn many cases, it may be due to a vasovagal syncope which is a common response to an overwarm\nenvironment or to a period of prolonged standing. It can also occur after a visual stimuli such as seeing\nblood on the floor. However, patients with vasovagal syncopes would normally feel dizzy and have\n‘tunnel vision’ prior to syncopal episode. This is not evident in this stem.\nINVESTIGATIONS FOLLOWING SYNCOPE\nThings to do for patients who had a syncopal event and recovered\n• Find witnesses – see if family members or friends have seen how the patient became unconscious –\nwas there a seizure?\n• Perform an ECG to look for arrhythmias\n• Perform blood pressure supine and standing or sitting to look for a postural drop\n• Check blood glucose to exclude hypoglycaemia",

  "answer": "Ventricular fibrillation",
  "explanation": "VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION (VF)\nVentricular Fibrillation means “sudden death”. The blood pressure drops immediately to zero and so does\nthe cardiac output. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the most important shockable cardiac arrest rhythm. The\nventricles suddenly attempt to contract at rates of up to 500 bpm. This rapid and irregular electrical\nactivity renders the ventricles unable to contract in a synchronised manner, resulting in immediate loss of\ncardiac output. Unless advanced life support is rapidly instituted, this rhythm is invariably fatal. Prolonged\nventricular fibrillation results in decreasing waveform amplitude, from initial coarse VF to fine VF and\nultimately moving on to asystole due to progressive depletion of myocardial energy stores.\nECG Findings for V. Fib:\n• Chaotic irregular deflections of varying amplitude\n• No identifiable P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves\n• Rate 150 to 500 per minute\n• There is no specific pattern to the discharge.

Treatment in this group of patients is\nespecially important.\nThe management for a person with hypertension alone differs slightly when compared to the\nmanagement of a patient with hypertension and diabetes.\nFirst-line antihypertensive drug treatment in a hypertensive patient with diabetes should be an ACE\ninhibitor unless the patient is Afro-Caribbean. Age here is irrelevant when the patient has diabetes.\nGiven the benefits of ACE inhibitors in terms of reno-protection and retinopathy, it is appropriate to\nrecommend an ACE inhibitor as first line for the treatment of hypertension in most adults with type 2\ndiabetes.

It is usually the U wave that is mistaken for the T wave. These are situations which may\nfalsely suggest a prolonged Q-T interval.\nThis is an example of a prominent U wave. A low T wave followed by a prominent U wave produces a\n‘camel-hump’ effect.\nAs hypokalaemia progresses to be more severe, the T wave decreases in amplitude and is flattened or\nbecomes inverted.

  "choice_c": "Atrial fibrillation",
  "choice_d": "Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia",

  "answer": "Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia",
  "explanation": "A polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is when there is beat-to-beat variations with no uniform pattern of\nventricular contraction. This is also known as Torsades de points.\nRemember the ECG being described is one at rest, not during the fainting episode (when QRS would be\nbroad due to the ventricular tachycardia)\nProlonged QT syndrome is when the QT interval is abnormally long, predisposing individuals to\nventricular arrhythmias (particularly Torsades de pointes), syncope and sudden death. There is no a pre-\nsyncope symptoms prior to fainting, which can be exacerbated by exercise, stress, medications and\nelectrolyte abnormalities.\nSick sinus syndrome is a group of conditions affecting the function of the sinoatrial node. It is usually\nassociated with periods of sinus bradycardia, tachy-brady syndrome, atrial fibrillation or flutter. It is not\nassociated with a prolonged QT interval.\nThe ECG demonstrates a sinus rhythm, which is not seen in complete heart block (P waves not\nassociated with QRS). Aystole is not associated with a prolonged QT interval.\nAtrial fibrillation does not lead to fainting. Remember the atria only contributes to 15% of the overall blood\nejected from the ventricle.",

  "explanation": "Not all myocardial infarction presents with the typical cardiac chest pain symptoms. Some may present\nwith atypical chest pain which can be described as an ache or discomfort. Other atypical symptoms\ninclude abdominal discomfort or epigastric pain.\nAs there is ST elevation in leads I, II and aVF, this confirms the diagnosis of a myocardial infarction.\nPercutaneous intervention (PCI) would be the best management for myocardial infarction\nPOST MANAGEMENT OF HEART FAILURE AND MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI)\nHeart Failure MI\nDecrease mortality ALL pts with MI on discharge:\n1. ACE inhibitor (Enalapril, • Dual antiplatelet therapy: Aspirin\nLisinopril, Ramipril) + Copidogrel\n2. Beta blocker (Bisoprolol, Note: Aspirin is continued life long\nCarvedilol, Nebivolol) Clopidogrel for 12 months\n(Initiate one at a time) • Beta Blockers\nOffer BB to people who present\nacutely with MI as soon as they are\nManage symptoms haemodynamically stable\nFurosemide Continue a beta blocker for at least\n12 months after an MI in people\nAdd on if symptoms are not without heart failure.\ncontrolled: Continue a beta-blocker indefinitely\nSpironolactone, or in people with HF\nDigoxin • ACEI\nOffer ACEI to people who present\nacutely with MI as soon as they are\nhaemodynamically stable\nIf intolerant to ACEi – use ARB\n• STATINS\nMYOCARDIAL INFARCTION MANAGEMENT\nMyocardial infarction management is tricky and it is always changing.\nA good way to remember the first few steps of managing myocardial infarction is to remember the\nmnemonic MONA=Morphine, O2, Nitrates, Aspirin 300 mg\nMorphine is given intravenously to manage the pain.\nOxygen is administered if there is evidence of hypoxia, pulmonary oedema, or continuing myocardial\nischaemia.\nNitrates such as GTN sublingual or by intravenous infusion is used to treat angina.\nAspirin 300 mg should be given preferably before arrival to hospital. Clopidogrel 300 mg should also be\ngiven.\nHeparin (unfractionated) or a low molecular weight heparin (e.g. enoxaparin sodium) should also be\nconsidered.\nFor STEMIs, current recommendations are to revascularize with percutaneous coronary intervention\n(PCI) if within 12 hours of onset of symptoms and if PCI can be delivered within 120 minutes of the time\nwhen fibrinolysis could have been given.\nMany hospitals have 24-hour PCI capacity. Ambulances who pick up patients with ST elevations are\nusually directed to hospitals with such facilities however in the event the ST elevation is only picked up\nafter the patient arrives to a hospital without catheterisation laboratories, the patient would be transferred\nout to another hospital with PCI facilities usually within 30 minutes of presentation.\nSTEMI management summary\n• If patient presents to hospital with symptom onset within 12 hours AND PCI can be delivered within\n120 minutes of the time when fibrinolysis could have been given – perform PCI\n• If PCI not available and cannot be delivered within 120 minutes of time when fibrinolysis could have\nbeen given – Thrombolysis (Alteplase)\n• Thrombolysis can only be done within 12 hours of symptom onset",

They will mention a type of systolic murmur THAT IS LOUDER WHEN THE\nPATIENT SITS UPRIGHT.\nRemember, the murmur for aortic stenosis is an ejection systolic murmur loudest in aortic area (2nd\nintercostal space, right sternal border), radiates to carotids, and louder in expiration\nAORTIC STENOSIS\nCauses\n• Degenerative calcification (most common cause in older patients above 65)\n• Bicuspid aortic valve (2nd most common cause, usually in the younger age group)\nClinical features\n• Dyspnoea\n• Angina\n• Syncope\nRemember, the murmur for aortic stenosis is an ejection systolic murmur loudes in aortic area (2nd\nintercostal space, right sternal border), radiates to carotids, and louder in expiration",

  "choice_b": "Amlodipine",
  "choice_c": "Aminophylline",
  "choice_d": "Propanolol",
  "choice_e": "Diltiazem",
  "answer": "Digoxin",
  "explanation": "The words “yellow haloes” are a clincher for digoxin toxicity.\nFor PLAB, if you see any question with yellow-green colour vision with arrhythmia, it is most likely digoxin\ntoxicity.\nDigoxin is now mainly used for rate control in the management of atrial fibrillation. As it has postiive\ninotropic properties it is sometimes used for improving symptoms (but not mortality) in patients with heart\nfailure.\nAlso remember, hypokalaemia predisposes to toxcitiy because potassium and digoxin bind to the same\nsite on the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, leading to increased intracellular calcium and increased\ncardiac contractility.\nFeatures of digoxin toxicity\n• Gastrointestinal symptoms are most common. These are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia\n• Neurologic and visual symptoms include blurred vision, yellow-green vision, hallucinations and\nconfusion\n• Arrhythmias – Bradycardia, premature contractions, ventricular tachycardia, and any other type of\narrhythmias may be seen.\nA serum digoxin level should be ordered in patients you suspect of being toxic (history, etc.).\nManagement of digoxin toxicity\n• Digibind\n• Correct arrhythmias\n• Monitor potassium",

  "explanation": "Atrial myxomas are benign tumours.\nAround three quarters of atrial myxomas occur in the left atria, and tend to grow on the wall (septum).\nSometimes small pieces of the tumour can break off and fall into the bloodstream. If this happens, they\ncan block an artery elswhere in the body such as the brain, which could cause a stroke, or in the lungs\ncausing a pulmonary embolus.\nAround 10% of myxomas seem to be inherited (passed down through families). These are known as\nfamilial myxomas.\nThe symptoms occur due to obstruction of the mitral valve which result in syncope and heart failure.\nFeatures\n• Symptoms of haemodynamic obstruction, embolisation, or constitutional symptoms such as fever,\nmalaise, tachycardia and tachypnoea\n• Symptoms and signs of ischaemia or infarction in the peripheries, due to embolisation of adherent\nthrombus\n• Atrial fibrillation\n• Large myxomas may impair intracardiac blood flow, causing dyspnoea, syncope or symptoms and\nsigns of congestive cardiac failure\n• Echo: pedunculated heterogeneous mass typically attached to the fossa ovalis region of the\ninteratrial septum",

  "answer": "Ventricular ectopic",
  "explanation": "From the given options the most likely answer is ventricular ectopics. This is a classic scenario where the\npatient would complain of having “missed beats”. They are usually otherwise asymptomatic. If ventricular\nectopics occur in a normal heart (i.e. no cardiomyopathy or ischaemic heart disease) though\nsymptomatic, it is benign and are of no clinical significance.\nVENTRICULAR ECTOPICS:\n• Caused by the premature discharge of a ventricular ectopic focus which produces an early\nand broad QRS complex\nAetiology:\n• Ischaemic heart disease\n• Cardiomyopathy\n• Stress, alcohol, caffeine, medication, cocaine, or amphetamines\n• Occurs naturally\nPatients may be symptomatic with palpitations often described as \"skipped or missed beats\" but\nthey may also have symptoms of dyspnoea or dizziness. Over half the population have silent, or\nasymptomatic, ventricular ectopics which are discovered incidentally on a routine ECG.\nIn clinical practice, it is important to identify the presence of an underlying cardiomyopathy or\nischaemic heart disease. If neither of these are present then it is likely that these ventricular\nectopics are benign.\nPatients with no ischaemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy have an excellent prognosis\nhowever, if ventricular ectopics are secondary to heart disease like myocardial infarction, it may\nprecipitate to more life-threatening arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation.",

  "explanation": "The ECG revealing a broad complex tachycardia with absence of atrial activity in a conscious\nperson can only be ventricular tachycardia. The hypotension seen here supports this. Cardiac\narrhythmias are more common in patients with Ischaemic heart disease hence the given history.\nOccasionally, in the exam, they may include a picture of an ECG showing a broad complex\ntachycardia. Again, pick ventricular tachycardia if the patient is still a wake as it is impossible to\nsee a ventricular fibrillation in an awake patient.\nVentricular tachycardia\nVentricular tachycardia may impair cardiac output with consequent hypotension, collapse, and\nacute cardiac failure. This is due to extreme heart rates and lack of coordinated atrial\ncontraction (loss of “atrial kick”).\nThe rate of V. Tach is from about 100-250 bpm. P Waves may be present or absent. P waves\nare usually not seen if the rate is increased. If present, the P Waves have no relation to the\nQRS complexes of the V. Tach.\nV. tach can present in two ways.\n1.

  "explanation": "The patient is suffering from acute pulmonary oedema brought upon by heart failure. It is worth noting\nthat this stem is a little tricky as there were no risk factors of heart failure mentioned and the information\nthat the women had a recent C-section makes physicians (especially if you have worked in an obstetric\nunit), think of a pulmonary embolism. However, it is important to be aware that cardiac causes of\nbreathlessness do occur in pregnancy and post delivery as well. This stem gives the history of orthopnea\nwhich clearly points towards heart failure as the reason for the shortness of breath.\nIn terms of management of acute pulmonary oedema, 4 important steps need to be done:\n1. Sit patient up, and give oxygen – aim for saturations ≥ 95% (>90% in those with COPD)\n2. Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) spray two puffs sublingual\n3. Furosemide 40 mg intravenously (slowly) produces transient venodilation and subsequent diuresis\n4.

  "answer": "Mitral regurgitation",
  "explanation": "It is clear from the stem that this patient has mitral regurgitation. There are two types of\nmitral regurgitation: primary (degenerative) MR and secondary (functional) MR.\nFrom the patient’s past medical history we can see that she has had a relatively recent\nmyocardial infarction. The most important complications of a myocardial infarction that\nwe need to recognise in this stem is mitral valve dysfunction and an atrial arrhythmia.\nVALVULAR HEART DISEASE\nWe have listed the common heart valve disorders here. There are certain keywords\nthat if you see in the exam, would help point you towards a specific heart valve disorder.\nWe have written them in red for you on this page.\nAortic stenosis\nAortic valve stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in the UK hence the\nmost commonly asked heart valve question. The two most common pathogenesis are\nage-related degenerative sclerocalcific changes to valves (most common cause, usually\nan elderly patient) and congenital bicuspid aortic valve (seen in a younger person with\naortic stenosis).\nSigns\nEjection systolic murmur best heard at the 2nd intercostal space, at the right sternal\nborder which radiates to carotid arteries.\nMitral regurgitation\nMitral regurgitation (MR), which is also known as mitral insufficiency, is the second most\ncommon heart valve disorder.\nSigns\nSoft S1 and S2, pansystolic murmur at the 5th intercostal space in the left midclavicular\nline which radiates to the axilla.\nA useful method to remember is to remember this phrase “when cooking, you really do\nnot want to regurgitate onto the cooking pan”. This is a good way to remember\npansystolic murmurs are found in mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (and also in\nventricular septal defects).\nMitral valve prolapse\nMitral valve prolapse is common inheritable connective tissue disorders like Marfan’s\nsyndrome, Ehlers Danlos syndrome and osteogenesis imperfecta. Most patients are\nasymptomatic. The classical case would be a slim young female with low blood\npressure. Mitral valve prolapse is a risk factor for mitral regurgitation.\nSigns\nMid-systolic click, best heard at 5th intercostal space in the left midclavicular line,\nfollowed by a mid or late-systolic murmur with findings accentuated in the standing\nposition.\nEver watch basketball? The MVP (Most Valuable Player which has the same acronyms\nas mitral valve prolapse) is the best performing player of the basketball season. He is\ntall, thin, with long arms (like in Marfan syndrome) and has loose joints (like in Ehlers\nDanlos syndrome). He shoots from the middle of the court with great “syspense” and\nfinishes with the ball entering the net with a click (mid-systolic click).\nMitral stenosis\nRheumatic heart disease is the commonest cause of mitral stenosis worldwide.\nSigns\nMid-diastolic murmur with an opening click (the click represents the mitral valve\nopening) best heard at the 5th intercostal space in the left midclavicular line.\nMichael Schumacher who is one of the greatest Formula One drivers ever has the same\ninitials as mitral stenosis. He had a terrible accident in the middle of his ski trip which\nhe almost diad”\nAortic regurgitation\nAortic regurgitation causes include rheumatic heart disease, infective endocarditis,\nMarfan syndrome amongst others.\nSigns\nEarly diastolic murmur, best heard at left sternal edge\nPulmonary stenosis\nSigns\nEjection systolic murmur best heard over pulmonary area, radiates to the left shoulder\nor infraclavicular region.\nTricuspid regurgitation\nSigns\nPansystolic murmur best heard over tricuspid region.\nOther common mnemonics that can help you remember heart murmurs are:\nLeft sided murmurslouder with Expiration\nRight sided murmurs louder with inspiration",

  "choice_c": "Aspirin",
  "choice_d": "Statins",

  "explanation": "Firstly, we must define what a non-disabling ischaemic stroke is. It is defined as an\nischaemic stroke with symptoms that last for more than 24 hours but later resolve,\nleaving no permanent disability. The reason this is important is often anticoagulation\ntreatment is deferred for at least 14 days from onset in people with disabling ischaemic\nstroke for a fer of a haemorrhagic event. In the interim aspirin 300 mg daily will be\nused.\nFor non-disabling ischaemic strokes, it depends on specific circumstances.\nNonetheless, in this question they are asking for a long term prophylactic regimen and\nthus warfarin is still the best option whether it started in 14 days time or right away.\nHe has atrial fibrillation which could lead to another stroke which is the reason that\nanticoagulation is extremely important. If atrial fibrillation was not included in this\nquestion, then the answer would be aspirin for 2 weeks and clopidogrel long term for\nstroke prevention.\nNICE updated their guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 2014.\nThey suggest using the CHA DS -VASc score to determine the most appropriate\n2 2\nanticoagulation strategy. This scoring system superseded the CHADS score.\n2\nAs this patient has had a stroke and his age is between 65-74 years, this gives him a\nCHA DS -VASc score of 3. In general, we offer anticoagulation if the CHA DS -VASc\n2 2 2 2\nscore is 2 or more.",

However, in the context of allergic reactions, IM adrenaline should only be\nused in anaphylactic shock whereby the patient would have breathing difficulties.\nThe followings are the indications of adrenaline in anaphylaxis:\n1. Hoarseness of voice\n2. Wheeze\n3. Shortness of breath\n4. Shock\n5. Stridor\n6. Swelling of the tongue and cheek\n7. Facial swelling\nIf you see an urticaria like allergic reaction, with none of the following indications stated\nabove for adrenaline, then pick the oral antihistamine as the answer.\nIf there was a choice to pick a non-sedating antihistamine (e.g. cetirizine or loratadine),\npick it over a sedating antihistamine (e.g. chlorpheniramine), unless there was a reason\nto pick a sedating antihistamine e.g. difficulty sleeping.\nURTICARIA\nThe typical lesion is a central itchy white papule or plaque due to swelling of the surface\nof the skin (wheals). This is surrounded by an erythematous flare. The lesions are\nvariable in size and shape and may be associated with swelling of the soft tissues of the\neyelids, lips and tongue (angioedema).\nIndividual lesions are typically transient.

  "explanation": "This patient’s investigations have all returned back normal. The clue here is picking up\nthe fact that her symptoms were not relieved by sublingual GTN. This tells us that it is\nunlikely ACS or unstable angina although in reality we do not use people’s response to\nglyceryl trinitrate (GTN) to make a diagnosis. However, this is an exam, and these\nphrases are sometimes used to inform you that this is not an ischaemic event. In reality,\nif bloods were requested and taken, a troponin would likely be added in and sent off as\nwell.\nThe stem also drops another hint letting you know that she has no medical problems.\nShe therefore does NOT have diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia or a\nsmoking history which are risk factors for an acute coronary syndrome.\nDo not get thrown by the slight tachycardia in the stem as it is likely the result from\nanxiety of the chest discomfort.\nCostochondritis is the answer here and can sometimes mimic symptoms of an acute\ncoronary syndrome. Movements of the rib cage can produce pain. Costochondritis is\ninflammation of costochondral junctions of ribs or chondrosternal joints of the anterior\nchest wall. It is sometimes called Tietze’s syndrome, but it is not the same thing.\nTietze’s syndrome is the addition of swelling over the affected joints of the anterior chest\nwall.\nCOSTOCHONDRITIS\n• Usually presents in patients over 40\n• Painmay be described as sharp or aching\n• The pain is aggravated by movement such as deep inspiration, coughing or\nsneezing\n• Tenderness to palpation at sides of sternum\nThe diagnosis is a clinical one and it is a self-limiting disease.

It is also associated with cardiac disturbances including irregular\nheartbeat, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, sinoatrial block and AV block\nMetoprolol: bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia (especially in\nchildren) and seizures. Myocardial conduction delays with decreased contractility typify\nthe acute beta-blocker ingestion.\nThiazide: hypotension, fever, frequent urination, hypotension, muscle cramps and\ntwitching\nThe two best contenderes are amitriptyline and carbamazepine. However, the single\nbest choice would be Amitriptyline because of the ECG changes.\nTRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT (TCA) OVERDOSE\nTricyclic antedepressant (TCA) overdose should always be considered potentially life-\nthreatening. They can deteriorate very rapidly sometimes within 1 hours of ingestion.\nClinical features\n• Dilated pupils\n• Dry mouth\n• Dry flushed skin\n• Urinary retention\n• Drowsiness and altered mental state leading to coma\n• Hypotension\nECG monitoring for TCA overdose is essential. The important ECG finding suggestive\nof TCA poisoning is QRS widening (>100 ms). Broad complex tachycardias may occur\nwhich are life threatening.\nTwo popular stems in the exam where the answer is likely to be TCA overdose is the\nyoung child that takes his/her grandparents medication who later becomes drowsy and\nlethargic. Another is an elderly person who has a terminal illness and wants to take\nhis/her own life who comes in the ED having dry and flushed and pupils are dilated.\nTCA’s are a prescription only medication andso you should think about how the person\nin the stem obtained the medication before you choose an answer.",

These segments of bone start to move independently of the chest wall and in\nthe opposite direction because of lung pressure. The result is a “paradoxical\nrespiration”.\nAetiology:\n• Fall (for example, off a bicycle or a horse)\n• Blunt trauma to the chest\n• Car accident\nDiagnosis:\nParadoxical respiration with shortness of breath and chest pain in a patient who has just\nhad blunt chest trauma raises the suspicion of a flail chest. The diagnosis is usually\nclinical but with help of a chest X-ray which would demonstrate rib fractures.\nManagement:\n1. High flow oxygen\n2.

This allows the bleeding point to\nbe visualised and treated. Band ligation is the first choice treatment for all patients\nwith upper gastrointestinal bleeding from oesophageal varices.\n• Administer terlipressin at presentation (2 mg intravenously repeated every 4 to 6\nhours).

  "choice_d": "Intubate and provide IPPV on 100% oxygen",
  "choice_e": "Refer to specialist unit",
  "answer": "Intubate and provide IPPV on 100% oxygen",
  "explanation": "As this patient is unconscious, we need to intubate and provide IPPV on 100% O2. For\na conscious patient use a tight-fitting mask with an O2 reservoir.\nThe decision for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a difficult one and there are\nmany debates about the added value provided by hyperbaric oxygen. As this patient is\nunconscious, one might suggest a transfer to a hyperbaric chamber but even so, this\nwill take time as you would need to call the Poisons Information Service and find the\nnearest locations of hyperbaric chambers. In the current NICE guidelines, treatment\nwith hyperbaric oxygen is not currently recommended, because there is insufficient\nevidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves long-term outcomes of people with\nsevere carbon monoxide poisoning, compared with standard oxygen therapy. Thus,\nbased on NICE guidelines, for any question in PLAB with CO2 poisoning, hyperbaric\noxygen therapy will NOT be the answer.\nIf this question was rewritten and asked for “What is the SINGLE most appropriate\nINITIAL management?, then mask with 100% oxygen would be a valid answer because\none would give 100% oxygen by mask first while preparing for intubation.\nCARBON MONOXIDE POISONING\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a tasteless and odourless gas produced by incomplete\ncombustion. Poisoning may occur from car exhausts, fires and faulty gas heaters. CO is\nalso produced by metabolism of methylene chloride (used in paint strippers and as an\nindustrial solvent).\nCO decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood by binding haemoglobin (Hb)\nto form carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb). This impairs O2 delivery from blood to the tissues\nthus causing severe tissue hypoxia.\nClinical features:\nEarly features are:\n• Headache\n• Malaise\n• Nausea and vomiting\nIn severe toxicity:\n• 'Pink' skin and mucosae\n• Hyperpyrexia\n• Arrhythmias\n• Coma with hyperventilation\nManagement\nNote: The elimination half-life of CO is about 4 hours on breathing air, 1 hour on 100%\nO2, and 23 minutes on O2 at 3 atmospheres pressure.\n• Clear the airway\n• Maintain ventilation with high concentration of O2\n• For a conscious patient use a tight-fitting mask with an O2 reservoir, but if\nunconscious intubates and provide IPPV on 100% O2\nIndications for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT):\nThere is debate about the added value provided by hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperbaric O2\ntherapy is logical, but of no proven benefit for CO poisoning. Transfer to a hyperbaric\nchamber and pressurization may take hours and so hyperbaric treatment may be no\nmore effective than ventilation on 100 % normobaric O2. Caring for a critically ill patient\nin a small pressure chamber may be impracticable.\nA COHb concentration of >20% should be an indication to CONSIDER hyperbaric\noxygen and the decision should be taken on the basis of the indicators listed below:\n• Loss of consciousness at any stage\n• Neurological signs other than headache\n• Myocardial ischaemia/arrhythmia diagnosed by ECG\n• The patient is pregnant.\nIf there are any of the indications stated above, discuss with a Poisons Information\nService and consider hyperbaric treatment. The Poisons Information Service can advise\non the location of hyperbaric chambers. But note currently, the treatment with\nhyperbaric oxygen is not currently recommended by NICE guidelines, because there is\ninsufficient evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves long- term outcomes of\npeople with severe carbon monoxide poisoning, compared with standard oxygen\ntherapy.",

A low risk patient would have the\nfollowing:\n• Urea < 6.5 mmol/L\n• Haemoglobin ≥ 130 g/L (men) or ≥ 120 g/L (women)\n• Systolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg\n• Pulse < 100 beats per min\n• Absence of melaena, syncope, cardiac failure, or liver disease\nAs this patient in this stem does not have any of the above, discharge would be\nappropriate, you can calculate this man’s Glasgow Blatchford score here for a better\nunderstanding: https://www.mdcalc.com/glasgow-blatchford-bleeding-score-gbs#next-\nsteps\nWe hope this explanation helps clears up the confusion between the answers.\nWe would consider for admission and early endoscopy (and calculations of full Rockall\nscore) if:\n• Aged ≥ 60 years (all patients who are aged > 70 years should be admitted); or\n• Witnessed haematemesis or haematochezia (suspected continued bleeding); or\n• Haemodynamic disturbance (systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg, pulse ≥ 100\nbeats per minute); or\n• Liver disease or known varices\n• Other significant comorbidity (especially cardiac disease, malignancy) should also\nlower the threshold for admission.",

It is characterised by\nupper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from mucosal lacerations in the upper\ngastrointestinal tract, usually at the gastro-oesophageal junction or gastric cardia.\nExcessive alcohol ingestion is one of the main causes as prolonged or forceful bout of\nvomiting can cause a tear in the upper gastrointestinal tract.\nLight-headedness and dizziness and features associated with the initial cause of the\nvomiting – eg, abdominal pain may be seen and are seen in this stem.\nResuscitation is a priority - maintain airway, provide high-flow oxygen, correct fluid\nlosses by giving IV fluids.

  "choice_d": "Thyroid storm",
  "choice_e": "Tracheomalacia",
  "answer": "Reactionary haemorrhage",
  "explanation": "Reactionary Haemorrhage occurs within the first 24 hours following trauma/surgery and\nit is usually caused by slipping of ligatures, dislodgement of clots, patient warming up\nafter surgery, causing vasodilation, on top of normalization of blood pressure.\nHaemostasis appears secure until blood pressure rises to normal then bleeding begins.\nTreatment usually involves replacing blood and re-exploring the wound.\nHypotension, tense neck and blood oozing from drain tells us that the patient is\nprobably bleeding. As the patient is still in recovery room, it is likely that the surgery is\nrecent (less than 24 hours) thus the diagnosis of reactionary haemorrhage.\nThe other options given are less likely\nPrimary haemorrhage → Occurs at the time of surgery. It is due to inadequate\nhaemostasis at the time of surgery or the displacement of a tie from the inferior pedicle.\nTreatment involves replacing blood. If severe, return to theatre for adequate\nhaemostasis.\nSecondary haemorrhage → Usually caused by necrosis of an area of blood vessel,\nrelated to previous repair anjd is often precipitated by wound infection. It occurs 1 to 2\nweeks post-op.\nThyroid storm → is an extreme form of thyrotoxicosis. This is an endocrine\nemergency. It is precipitated by stress, infection, surgery, or trauma. It is manifested by\nextreme irritability, delirium, coma, tachycardia, restlessness, vomiting, jaundice,\ndiarrhea, hypotension, dehydration,and high fever.\nTracheomalacia → refers to tracheal weakness. It is an abnormal collapse of the\ntracheal walls. Tracheostomy or endotracheal intubation can damage the tracheal\ncartilage at the stoma or inflatable cuff site, respectively, which weakens the tracheal\nwall. The major symptoms and signs of TM in adults are dyspnea, cough, and sputum\nretention. Wheezing or stridor may also exist.",

  "answer": "Paracetamol",
  "explanation": "The raised level of serum creatinine, bilirubin, liver enzymes as well as the increased\nprothrombin time indicates that this patient has taken an overdose of paracetamol.\nParacetamol is an antipyretic and analgesic. Patients are usually asymptomatic for the\nfirst 24 hours or have nonspecific abdominal symptoms. Hepatic necrosis begins to\ndevelop after 24 hours and can progress to acute liver failure. The liver damage isnot\nusually detectable by routine liver function testuntil at least 18 hours after ingestion of\nparacetamol. Alanine transferase (ALT), prothrombin time usually peak 72 to 96 hours\nafter ingestion. In the United Kingdom, paracetamol can be purchased over the\ncounter; however, it is government legislation that it is not to be sold in excess of ten\ntablets at a time. For an average person, 24 tablets usually constitute an overdose.\nThe other answers are unlikely.\nAmitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. TCA’s taken in large amounts can cause\nexcess sedation, sympathomimetic effects (tachycardia, sweating, dilated pupils)\nAspirin is a potent antiplatelet agent as well as an antipyretic, analgesic and anti-\ninflammatory agent. An overdose of aspirin causes ringing in the ears, nausea,\nabdominal pain, and tachypnoea.\nVenlafaxine is a type of antidepressant of the selective serotonin-norepinephrine\nreuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class often used to treat depression, anxiety and panic\nattacks. Most patients overdosing with venlafaxine develop only mild symptoms of\nfeeling tired, palpitations and vomiting. They rarely cause death.\nOrganophosphates are usually the active ingredietn in insecticides. Symptoms include\nincreased saliva and tear production, diarrhoea, vomiting, small pupils, sweating,\nmuscle tremors, and confusion.\nPARACETAMOL (ACETAMINOPHEN) POISONING\nInitial features → Nausea, vomiting, pallor\nAfter 24 hours → Hepatic enzymes rise\nAfter 48 hours → Jaundice, an enlarged, tender liver\nHypoglycaemia, hypotension, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, coma may also occur.\nWhen to discharge home?\nIf ingestion of paracetamol is < 150mg/kg in a child/adult with no hepatic risk factors\nWhen to admit?\n• Admit those presenting within 8h of ingesting >150mg/kg (or an unknown amount)\n(For the exam, it can be quite time consuming to multiply 150mg with the weight of\nthe patient. So, we would advise you to use the number 24 as a benchmark whereby\nif the patient consumes more than 24 tablets (12 g) of paracetamol, then you admit\nhim/her)\nWhen to do a serum paracetamol concentration?\n• At ≥4h post ingestion if consumed >150mg/kg (or an unknown amount)\nWhen to give activated charcoal?\n• If presenting < 1h, and >150mg/kg of tablets ingested\nWhen to give N-acetylcysteine?\n• If there is a staggered overdose (Note: a staggered overdose is if all the tablets were\nnot taken within 1 hour); or\n• If there is doubt over the time of paracetamol ingestion, regardless of the plasma\nparacetamol concentration; or\n• If plasma paracetamol concentration (taken 4 hours’ post ingestion) is above the\nappropriate line\n• If patients present late (>8h) and ingested dose is >150mg/kg, (or dose is unknown)",

The anaesthetist needs to urgently review this patient as intubation\nwould be the first part of management to secure her airways.

  "choice_d": "Gastric lavage",
  "choice_e": "Intravenous insulin",
  "answer": "Naloxone",
  "explanation": "A low respiratory rate, constricted pupils, semiconscious are features of opioid\npoisoning. Naloxone is a specific antagonist for opioids and used especially in opioid\noverdose to reverse coma and respiratory depression. When given intravenously, it can\nbegin to work within 2 minutes. The usual initial dose of naloxone for adults is 0.8 mg\nintravenously (BNF says 0.4 mg initially then 0.8 mg). Dosingmaybe repeated at 2-3\nminute intervals if there is minimal or no response. In known or suspected drug addicts\nit is best to avoid reversing the opioid completely, so start with 0.1 mg of Naloxone\nintravenously. This again can be repeated at 2-3 minutes intervals.\nNaloxone has a much shorter duration of action compared to most opioids and so coma\nand respiratory depression recur when naloxone wears off thus repeated dosing may be\nrequired at a later time.\nIt is unlikely that the PLAB exam would ask you for the dose of Naloxone in the exam,\nbut it is worth remembering if you planto work in A&E in future.\nPUPILLARY RESPONSES TO LIGHT\nAn acutely widely dilated pupil unilaterally may be seen in unilateral space-occupying\nlesions such as haematomas, tumours or abscesses.\nBilateral abnormally constricted pupils may indicate opiate overdose or a\ncerebrovascular accident affecting the brainstem\nBilaterally dilated pupils occur when there are sympathetic drugs that were taken e.g.\ntricyclic antidepressant overdose.",

The\ndoctors that write the PLAB test questions may have written them prior to publishing\nnew guidelines and this may be overlooked by the organizers. When this occurs, the\norganizers for the PLAB test will award marks for both answers when evaluating the\npapers. This is a very rare event but may still occur. Thus, do not spend too much time\ntrying to decide which is the right or wrong option between the two.\nFor healthcare provider and layperson\nCPR should be started with the C:V ratio that is familiar and for most, this will be 30:2.\nThe paediatric modifications to adult CPR should be taught to those who care for\nchildren but are unlikely to have to resuscitate them. The specific paediatric sequence\nincorporating the 15:2 ratio is primarily intended for those who have the potential to\nresuscitate children as part of their role.\nIn the case above, the parents are unlikely to need to resuscitate their child and a CPR\nC:V ratio that is familiar which is 30:2 is appropriate.\nNote: that if you were a paediatrician you should be doing C:V ratio of 15:2 as you\npotentially need to resuscitate children as part of your role.\nNote there are two options for chest compression. Either index and middle finger of one\nhand or grip the chest in both hands in such a way that two thumbs can press on the\nlower third of the sternum.\nChest compression in infants:\n• The lone rescuer should compress the sternum with the tips of two fingers.\n• If there are two or more rescuers, use the encircling technique:\no Place both thumbs flat, side-by-side, on the lower halfe of the sternum (as\nabove), with the tips pointing towards the infant’s head.\no Spread the rest of both hands, with the fingers together, encircle the lower part of\nthe infant’s rib cage with the tips of the fingers supporting the infant’s back.\no Press down on the lower sternum with your two thumbs to depress it at least\none-third of the depth of the infant’s chest, approximately 4 cm.\nChest compression (only to be started after succesful lung inflation).

  "explanation": "Hyperventilation is an abnormally increased pulmonary ventilation. Patients with\nhyperventilation syndrome may feel that they are not able to breathe sufficient air. In\nreality their oxygenation in the arterial blood is within normal limits. Due to the rapid\nbreathing, carbon dioxide levels fall which result in respiratory alkalosis.\nThe complaint is usually of a paroxysmal nature rather than continuous.

After losing consciousness, breathing\nand blood gases return to normal which restores cerebral blood flow. The patient would\nshortly recover after that.\nManagement includes rebreathing into the paper bag to terminate the attack.

  "choice_d": "Increased aldosterone",
  "choice_e": "Increased anti-diuretic hormone",
  "answer": "Increased sympathetic activity",
  "explanation": "This question is testing basic physiology.\nAcute pain or trauma will activate your body’s sympathetic nervous system. This will\ncause many of the body’s blood vessels to constrict and will cause the heart to increase\nthe rate and force of contraction.\nThis patient has just experienced a traumatic accident and is probably bleeding\ninternally, as is evidenced by the abdominal bruising. Excessive blood loss results in a\ndrop of blood pressure. However, the single most likely cause of his cold and clammy\nperipheries is due to activation of the sympathetic nervous system causing constriction\nof the blood vessels. This is due to a compensatory mechanism by the body to\npreserve itself.\nAlthough severe trauma or stressful events can elevate cortisol levels, this is not a\ndirect reason as to why this patient has cold and clammy peripheries.\nThe parasympathetic nervous system acts in the opposite way as to the sympathetic\nnervous system. An activation of the parasympathetic nervous system would cause\nvessel dilation and would cause the patient’s peripheries to appear warm and flushed.\nPeriods of stress and trauma also cause an increase in aldosterone and anti-diuretic\nhormone. In addition, aldosterone would have been released in this patient due to\nactivation of the baroreceptors with the aim of causing sodium and water retention and\nthus increasing blood volume and blood pressure.

  "explanation": "This patient has a scald (a burn caused by contact with hot water or steam). Scalds\nand burns are graded and managed in the same way.\nAnalgesia should be the first thing to be prescribed and this patient should then be\nreferred to a specialised burn service.\nEvery hospital has different criterias to refer patients to specialised burn services. Most\nof them would include the following criterias:\n• More than 3% of total body surface area partial thickness burn\n• Burns involving the face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum, or major joints\n• All deep dermal and full thickness burns\n• All burns associated with electrical shock or chemical burns\n• All burns associated with non-accidental injury\n• All burns with inhalation injury\nHis hands are involved and there is significant amount of body surface area involved, so\nit would be appropriate to refer onto a specialist burn service which are run by\nexperienced burn surgeons. Hand burns are not to be taken lightly because inadequate\nmanagement can result in a serious disability.\nBecause burn units in the UK consist of experienced personnel with resources to\nmaximize outcome from these injuries, burned patients with these criteria are best\ntreated in such places.\nThe story in this stem seems to match the physical findings of the scald. However, it is\nimportant to keep at the back of your head that a significant percentage of burns in\nchildren are due to child abuse and so if the story did not match or there was a delay in\npresenting, you may need to contact child protection and refer to the specialised burn\nservices for further evaluation.\nNICE CKS suggest that blisters should be left intact wherever possible, to reduce the\nrisk of infection however large blisters that are likely to rupture (greater than 1 cm2) can\nbe de-roofed under aseptic techniques. As the size of the blisters are not mentioned in\nthis stem, de-roofing or aspirating the blisters may be a possibility however since we are\ncertain that this child needs to be transferred to a specialist burn service, that would be\nthe answer.",

This usually occurs around the 24 hour mark after ingestion\nfor adults.\nParacetamol overdose may also cause metabolic acidosis in the early and late course\nof poisoning and thus paracetamol as an answer is not completely wrong. However,\naspirin overdose is a more recognized cause of metabolic acidosis compared to\nparacetamol.\nOverdose of Enalapril (ACE inhibitor) or Diclofenac (NSAIDs) cause metabolic alkalosis\nand not acidosis.\nOverdose of Benzodiazepines would cause respiratory acidosis.\nIf suspecting metabolic acidosis do a blood gas.

  "explanation": "This patient has an adrenal crisis. This is an emergency.\nClues that point you toward this patient having an adrenal insufficiency is the\nmention of hyponatraemia, hyperkaleimia upon blood testing. Addison’s disease\ndescribes a condition of primary adrenal insufficiency. If a patient with known\nadrenal insufficiency presents with adrenal crisis, intravenous steroids need to be\nadministered to rapidly decrease the inappropriate vasopressin production which\ntherefore increases clearance of free water and corrects hyponatraemia.\nAn adrenal crisis can be precipitated in patients with an adrenal insufficiency by\nconditions such as an infection, trauma or surgery. The most common cause is\nusually a sudden withdrawal of chronic steroid therapy however in this scenario\nthe reason for this patient’s adrenal crisis is probably an infection as evidenced\nby his high body temperature.\nTreatment steps for patients with a suspected adrenal crisis:\n1. Hydrocortisone IV\n2. Normal saline infusion\n3. Cardiac and electrolyte monitoring\n4. Broad spectrum antibiotics if infection is suspected as the precipitating cause.\n5. Hydrocortisone in 5% glucose via IV infusion\n6. Weaningoff of IV steroidsandcommencing oral steroids\nFrom the above steps, we can determine that the next best step in the treatment\nof this patient is to administer hydrocortisone since a normal saline infusion has\nalready been started.\nIf you chose 5% glucose infusion, you are partially correct. This patient has\nhypoglycaemia and should be given glucose. But this is the wrong step in\nmanagement at this stage. This answer is therefore incorrect.\nIt is very rare that you would ever use 0.45% normal saline in clinical practice.\nGenerally, it is usually given in hypernatraemia along with dextrose and\npotassium. If this was given to this patient, this hypotonic saline would worsen\nthe hyponatraemia.\nIntravenous potassium would likely kill this patient. This is the blatantly incorrect\nanswer here.\nIntravenous antibiotics are to be used to treat the underlying disorder (which is\nprobably an infection in this case), but again the more important step here is\nintravenous hydrocortisone.",

Check the capillary blood glucose and, if < 4 mmol/L, immediately proceed to\ninitiating treatment\n3. Take venous sample for formal blood glucose\nCommon causes\n• Drug induced: Sulphonylureas used to treat diabetes or excessive insulin\n• Alcohol – Impairs hepatic gluconeogenesis\n• Addison’s disease – Inadequate counter-regulatory reponse (e.g. cortisol) to\ninsulin\n• Liver failure – Impaired hepatic glucose production\n• Certain medications e.g. paracetamol excess, quinine, salicylates\nFurther investigations\n• If it is unclear why the person has hypoglycaemia, consider investigations\nsuch asrenal function, liver function, full blood count, coagulation and\nparacetamol/salicylate levels\n• Rarely, but importantly, it may be appropriate to consider checking:\no Serum cortisol\no Insulin and C-peptide levels\no Urine for sulphonylureas\nTreatment of hypoglycaemia\nThis is an example guideline to provide you with an idea of how hypoglycaemia is\nmanaged in the hospital. Every hospital has a different set of guidelines.\nOther notes\n• Regular blood glucose monitoring should continue for 24-48 hours\n• Glucose 50% IV is rarely given now as it is hypertonic and may damage veins\n• Glucagon 1 mg IM or SC is usually administered by ambulance crew or when\nIV access is difficulty\n• If hypoglycaemia is induced by excess oral hypoglycaemics or insulin\noverdose, maintenance glucose infusions intravenously may be required for\n24 hours or longer\nKey points to remember:\n• Exclude hypoglycaemia in any patient with a coma, altered mental state,\nconfusion, or reduce consciousness\n• The commonest cause of hypoglycaemia is an imbalance of insulin or oral\nhypoglycaemic medication that is required by the patient.

The tingling around his mouth is called\nperioral paraesthesia, which, in combination with twitching facial muscles leads\nus to think that this is hypocalcaemia. Thie history of diabetes was given as\nanother hint for the diagnosis. He most likely has a degree of chronic renal\nimpairment due to diabetes which supports the findings of hypocalcaemia.\nHYPOCALCAEMIA\nCommon causes\n• vitamin D deficiency (osteomalacia)\n• chronic renal failure\nLess common causes\n• Hypoparathyroidism (e.g. post thyroid/parathyroid surgery)\n• Hyperphosphatemia\n• Hypomagnesemia\nAlso, note hyperventilation can include a transietn hypocalcaemia however the\nserum calcium levelsare usually normal.\nThe clinical history combined with parathyroid hormone levels will reveal the\ncause of hypocalcaemia in the majority of cases\nClinical Findings\nHypocalcaemia results in increased neural hyperexcitability such as seizures,\ntetany, circumoral numbness, and tingling of the extremities. Arrhythmias may\ndevelop because of a prolonged QT.\nA mnemonic to help is with clinical signs and symptoms is: “SPASMODIC”\n• S → Spasm (carpopedal spasms = Trousseau's sign)\n• P → Perioral paraesthesiae\n• A → Anxious, irritable, irrational\n• S → Seizures\n• M → Muscle tone increased in smooth muscles\n• O → Orientation impaired (time, place and person) and confusion\n• D → Dermatitis\n• I → Impetigo herpetiformis (rare and serious)\n• C → Chvostek’s sign, Cardiomyopathy (long QT interval on ECG)\nExamination findings:\n• Trousseau’s sign in which the wrist flexes and the fingers are drawn together\nin response to occlusion of the brachial artery.\n• Chvostek’s sign in which facial muscles twitch in response to tapping over the\nparotid, revealing neuromuscular excitability due to the low calcium.\nManagement\n• Acute management of severe hypocalcaemia is with intravenous replacement\n(10 ml of 10% calcium gluconate over 30 minutes)\n• Further management depends on the underlying cause",

  "choice_d": "Cortisol suppression with a high dose of dexamethasone",
  "choice_e": "Unilateral adrenal enlargement",
  "answer": "Unilateral adrenal enlargement",
  "explanation": "One must remember that Cushing’s disease is not the same as Cushing’s\nsyndrome. Cushing’s syndrome are clinical signs and symptoms of excess\ncortisol. Cushing’s disease is a pituitary adenoma that causes Cushing’s\nsyndrome. Note however, Cushing’s syndrome could be cause by many other\naetiologies besides a pituitary adenoma.\nIn this stem, they are asking about Cushing’s disease (pituitary adenoma causing\ncushing’s syndrome).\nIn Cushing’s disease, the pituitary adenoma produces massive amounts of ACTH\nwhich travels through the bloodstream and causes the normal adrenal glands to\nmake excessive amounts of cortisol. This can lead to hyperactivity of both\nadrenal glands called bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Remember that both\nadrenals would respond to ACTH equally causing bilateral adrenal hyperplasia\nrather than unilateral adrenal enlargement.\nCUSHING’S SYNDROME\nA clinical state caused by prolonged exposure to elevated levels of either\nendogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids\nCauses can be divided into 2 groups:\n• Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent disease:\no Excessive ACTH from the pituitary (Cushing's disease)\no Ectopic ACTH-producing tumours (Especially small cell lung cancer and\ncarcinoid tumours)\n• Non-ACTH-dependent:\no Adrenal adenomas\no Adrenal carcinomas\no Excess glucocorticoid administration → This is the chief cause\nInvestigations:\nOutpatient tests\n• 24-hour urinary free cortisol → as an outpatient screening tool\n• Overnight dexamethasone suppression test → Administration of 1mg\ndexamethasone at midnight is followed by a serum cortisol measurement at\n9 a.m. Cortisol < 50 nmol/L makes Cushing’s unlikely. The 1 mg overnight\ndexamethasone suppression test is the best initial diagnostic test to establish\na diagnosis of Cushing syndrome.\nInpatient tests\n• ACTH levels → This is the next test to do once the diagnosis of Cushing’s\nsyndrome is confirmed. We do this test to differentiate between ACTH-\ndependent and ACTH-independent aetiologies. ACTH levels are elevated\nwith either a pituitary source of ACTH such as an adenoma or with an ectopic\nsource.\n• High-dose dexamethasone suppression test → This test is done to\ndifferentiate between a pituitary adenoma and an ectopic source. The output\nof a pituitary adenoma will suppress with high-dose dexamethasone (i.e.\ncortisol suppressed). The output of an ectopic source will not suppress with\nhigh-dose dexamethasone (i.e. cortisol not suppressed).\nThe reason that cortisol is suppressed in pituitary adenoma is because the\nadenoma is semi-autonomous. A low dose dexamethasone will not suppress it\nbut a high dose dexamethasone will. Whereas, ectopic ACTH producing tumours\nare fully autonomous and will not respond to a high dose dexamethasone\nsuppression test.\nInvestigations for Cushing’s syndrome is a must know especially when to use a\nhigh dose dexamethasone suppression test. It is a commonly asked question.",

She is\na professional athlete and is currently training hard for the 10 km long\ndistance race in the Olympics. She typically runs around twelve kilometres\nper day, at least five times per week. She has a very healthy lifestyle and\ndoes not smoke or drink alcohol. On physical examination, her body mass\nindex is 19 kg/m2. There is dull pain on palpation along the fourth and fifth\nmetatarsal of her left foot. The physical examination was otherwise\nnormal. A blood sample was taken from the patient and her results are as\nfollows:\nFollicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 10 U/L\nLuteinizing horome (LH) 5 U/L\nProlactin 750 mU/L\nOestradiol 120 pmol/L\nWhat is the SINGLE most likely diagnosis for this patient?",
  "choice_a": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome",
  "choice_b": "Hypothalamic amenorrhoea",
  "choice_c": "Premature ovarian failure",
  "choice_d": "Ovulation induction drugs",
  "choice_e": "Coeliac disease",
  "answer": "Hypothalamic amenorrhoea",
  "explanation": "In this scenario, the patient has not been menstruating for twelve continuous\nmonths. This is termed secondary amenorrhoea. Secondary amenorrhoea can\nbe due to various different causes but in this patient, it is most likely due to\nhypothalamic dysfunction. She is an athlete by profession and hypothalamic\nfailure can occur due to excessive exercise, stress or being significantly\nunderweight. In this patient, the body mass index (BMI) is within normal range\n(18.5 to 25), so the cause of this patient’s hypothalamic dysfunction is excessive\nexercise and stress about the upcoming race.\nIn hypothalamic amenorrhoea, due to low levels of the gonadotrophin-releasing\nhormone (GnRH), there is a decrease in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and\nluteinizing hormone (LH). This will further decrease the release of oestrogen\nfrom the ovary. This can be seen in the laboratory values of this patient.\nIt is less likely that the patient has premature ovarian failure as there will be an\nelevation of FSH, which is not the case in this patient.\nThere is nothing to indicate in the scenario that the ptient has polycystic ovarian\nsyndrome, is taking ovulation induction drugs or that she has coeliac disease.\nAMENORRHOEA\nAmenorrhoea is the absence of menstruation. Pathological amenorrhoea is the\nfailure to menstruate for at least 6 months. Amenorrhoea can be divided into:\n• Primary amenorrhoea – lack of menstruation before age 16 years or 14 in the\nabsence of secondary characteristics\n• Secondary amenorrhoea – cessation of menstrual cycles following\nestablished cycles.\nAetiology\n• Hypothalamic amenorrhoea\no Most common\no Usually due to low BMI or excessive exercise\n• Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\n• Hyperprolactinaemia\n• Premature ovarian failure\no Raised FSH levels\n• Anatomical problems\no Usually results in primary amenorrhoea\no Vaginal examinations to rule out imperforate hymen is important\no Pelvic ultrasound also useful to determine the pelvic anatomy (Mullerian\nagenesis)\no Anatomical problems can also cause secondary amenorrhoea\n(Asherman’s syndrome)\n• Thyroid problems\no Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can cause amenorrhoea\nDon’t forget pregnancy as a cause of amenorrhoea\nSpecific to look for in the stems\n• Short stature – may indicate Turner syndrome\n• Hirsutism, acne (androgen excess) – May indicated PCOS or\nhyperprolactinaemia\n• Menopausal symptoms in women before age 40 – May indicate premature\novarian failure\n• Eating disorder – May indicate anorexia nervosa\n• Galactorrhoea – May indicate hyperprolactinaemia",

  "question": "A 63 year old man who takes spironolactone and ramipril for hypertension\nand was found to have elevated potassium of 5.8 mmol/L on routine blood\ntest on a day ward. He is otherwise well and has no allergies. An ECG is\ncarried out which is normal. What is the SINGLE best initial treatment in\nlight of his potassium levels?",
  "choice_a": "Intravenous calcium gluconate",
  "choice_b": "Renal dialysis",
  "choice_c": "Discontinue spironolactone and ramipril",
  "choice_d": "Recheck potassium level",
  "choice_e": "Intravenous insulin and glucose",
  "answer": "Discontinue spironolactone and ramipril",
  "explanation": "Spironolactone is a potassium sparing diuretics and ramipril is an ACEi. Both can\ncause\nhyperkalaemia.\nThere are different severities of hyperkaleimia, and these are as follows:\nMild – 5.5-5.9 mmol/L\nModerate – 6.0-6.4 mmol/L\nSevere: > 6.5 mmol/L\nThe aggression of treatment depends upon the level of potassium, the rate of\nrise of potassium and any ECG abnormalities seen.\nRemember the following in regards to ECG changes in hyperkaleimia\n• ECG may be normal even in severe hyperkaleimia\n• The absence of ECG changes does not mean there is no need for treatment\n• The presence of ECG changes means a need for urgent treatment\n• The severity of ECG changes does not always relate to the severity of\nhyperkaleimia\nTake note of how the question is phrased. It says, the best INITIAL treatment.\nThe best initial treatment is to discontinue the drugs that are directly contributing\ntoward this patient’s hyperkaleimia. As we can see, the potassium level in this\npatient is only slightly elevated so stopping the medication would suffice. We can\nexpect potassium levels to fall. It is important to check for symptoms and do an\nECG, but at this levels it is unlikely that patient is symptomatic or an ECG is\nabnormal.\nIn this question, the patient has a normal ECG with no symptoms so calcium\ngluconate is not indicated. This man is certainly not a candidate for dialysis.",

  "choice_c": "Cerebral deposits of amyloid plaques",
  "choice_d": "Hyponatraemia",
  "choice_e": "Hypercalcaemia",
  "answer": "Hypercalcaemia",
  "explanation": "Drowsiness and increased thirst with a history of breast cancer should spark the\nthought of hypercalcaemia as a differential. Breast cancers commonly spread to\nbones and remember, bone metastases are one of the most common causes of\nhypercalcaemia.\nFluoxetine has no significance in this scenario however depression can be\nworsened with hypercalcaemia.\nHYPERCALCAEMIA\nAetiology\n• Primary Hyperparathyroidism → This is the main cause of hypercalcaemia. It\nis the most common cause of hypercalcaemia but it is usually mild most of\nthe time so most patient have no symptoms at all\n• Malignancy → i.e. multiple myeloma, production of PTH like molecule\n(Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung). This is a common cause of\nhypercalcaemia that requires hospital admission\n• Familial Hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia\n• Immobilization\n• Sarcoidosis\nClinical features\nMnemonic: \"moans, stones, groans, and bones\".\n• Neuro and psych: Hypercalcemia results in decreased mental activity leading\nto lethargy, confusion and depression (Groans)\n• Gastrointestinal: Hypercalcemia results in decreased bowel activity such as\n• constipation (Moans)\n• Renal: Hypercalcemia results in polyuria and polydipsia because of the\ninduction of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Calcium also precipitates in the\nkidney, resulting in both kidney stones as well as nephrolithiasis. (Stones)\n• Bone pain is only seen when it is hyperparathyroidism which is causing\nhypercalcaemia (Bones)\n• Cardiovascular: The ECG shows a short QT\nHypercalcaemia: management\n• The initial management of hypercalcaemia is rehydration with normal saline,\ntypically 3-4 litres/day. Increasing the circulating volume with 0.9% saline,\nhelps to increase the urinary output of calcium\n• Following rehydration bisphosphonates may be administered intravenously.\nOther less used options include:\n• Calcitonin → It has fewer side-effects than bisphosphonates but is less\neffective in reducing hypercalcaemia.\n• Steroids in sarcoidosis\n• Cinacalcet hydrochloride is a calcimimetic agent that effectively reduces\nparathyroid levels in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism\n• Haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be relevant in patients with severe\nhypercalcaemia secondary to renal failure\n• Furosemide has a limited role → It is occasionally used where there is fluid\noverload but it does not reduce serum calcium",

  "choice_e": "Premature ovarian failure",
  "answer": "Prolactinoma",
  "explanation": "Prolactinomas are a form of pituitary tumour secreting prolactin.\nHyperprolactinemia in premenopausal women causes hypogonadism which\nresults in symptoms of infertility, oligomenorrhoea, or amenorrhoea and less\ncommonly galactorrhoea.\nHypothalamic amenorrhoea usually occurs due to chronic illness like being\nsignificantly underweight and rightly so, it is seen commonly in anorexia nervosa.\nDiagnosis of hypothalamic amenorrhoea with biochemical findings of low serum\ngonadotropins and low oestradiol with clinical picture of excessive exercise, low\nweight or stress.\nThere are no features of PCOS in this stem. In regards to biochemical test,\nelevated insulin levels, elevated LH levels and moderately elevated testosterone\nlevels would be seen seen in PCOS\nThe oestrogen levels would be low anx the gonadotropic hormones would be\nraised in premature ovarian failure.\nHYPERPROLACTINAEMIA\nExcess prolactin secretion is a common clinical problem in women and causes\nthe syndrome of galactorrhoea-amenorrhoea. The amenorrhoea appears to be\ncaused by inhibition of hypothalamic release of luteinizing hormone releasing\nhormone (LHRH) with a decrease in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-\nstimulating hormone (FSH) secretion. Prolactin inhibits the LH surge that causes\novulation.\nAlthough hyperprolactinaemia is also seen in men, gynecomastia and especially\ngalactorrhoea are very rare.\nEtiology\nhyperprolactinaemia can be seen in natural physiologic states such as\npregnancy, nipple stimulation/suckling, stress\nPituitary tumours such as prolactinomas\nHypothalamic disease → mass compressing stalk (craniopharyngioma,\nmeningioma)\nHyperprolactinaemia can also occur with decreased inhibitory action of\ndopamine. (e.g. Antipsychotic agents) –Antipsychotics are the most common\npharmacological cause of hyperprolactinaemia. Some are known dopamine D2\nreceptor antagonist and would raise serum prolactin. Remember a few of them\nlike risperidone and haloperidol as a cause of hyperprolactinaemia.\nHypothyroidism →TRH increases prolactin\nClinical of Hyperprolactinaemia\n• Galactorrhoea → usually in women.\no Premenopausal woman uncommonly get galactorrhoea\no Man rarely get galactorrhoea\n• Menstrual abnormalities → amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea,\n• Disturbed gonadal function in men → Erectile dysfunction, decreased libido,\ngynecomastia in men, reduced fertility\nClinical features of Mass effects (macroadenomas only)\n• Headaches and visual field defects (uni- or bitemporal field defects)\n• Hypopituitarism\nDiagnosis\n• Always exclude states such as pregnancy, lactation, hypothyroidism and\nmedications before starting the work-up of hyperprolactinaemia\n• Serum prolactin <2,000mU/L is suggestive of a tumour → either a\nmicroprolactinoma or a non-functioning macroadenoma compressing the\npituitary stalk\n• Serum prolactin >4,000mU/L is diagnostic of a macroprolactinoma.\n• Imaging: MRI\nFor the purpose of PLAB:\nThe normal level of prolactin is less than 400 mU/L. A very high prolactin level\n(>5000 mU/L) usually means that a prolactinoma is present. Levels in between\nmay be due to a prolactinoma, or to other causes",

  "question": "A 34 year old woman is referred to the endocrine clinic with a history of\nthyrotoxicosis. At her first appointment she is found to have a smooth\ngoiter, lid lag and bilateral exophthalmos with puffy eyelids. She wants to\ndiscuss the treatment of her thyroid problem as she is keen to become\npregnant. What is the SINGLE most likely treatment to be given to her?",
  "choice_a": "Carbimazole alone",
  "choice_b": "Propylthiouracil alone",
  "choice_c": "A combination of carbimazole and thyroxineA",
  "choice_d": "Radioactive iodine",
  "choice_e": "Thyroidectomy",
  "answer": "Propylthiouracil alone",
  "explanation": "Of the three recognised treatment options for hyperthyroidism (radioiodine\ntherapy, antithyroid drug therapy and surgery), generally only drug therapy\n(preferably propylthiouracil) is considered for treating pregnant women. As this\npatient is not yet pregnant but trying to conceive, there are no consensus on the\ntreatment option. However, it is likely that propylthiouracil would be the preferred\ntreatment as she has not attempted any anti-thyroid drug therapy in the past.\nBoth propylthiouracil (PTU) and carbimazole are effective in controlling the\ndisease in pregnancy. Historically, propylthiouracil has been preferred in\npregnancy because it is not associated with aplasia cutis and omphalocele,\nwhich may be the case for carbimazole. However, recent concern regarding\nhepatotoxicity of PTU, particularly in children, has led to recommendations that it\nshould only be prescribed in the first trimester. Nonetheless, PTU is the drug of\nchoice when trying to conceive (preconception) and also in the first three months\nof pregnancy. If PTU is not available,\ncarbimazole can be used.\nSurgical management is also something to consider and in a number of women\nplanning to become pregnant, it is the therapy of choice. As stated above, there\nare no consensus to which management pathway should be used but it is likely\nthat propylthiouracil would be attempted first before considerations of surgery.\nWhile subtotal or near total thyroidectomy achieves a 98% cure rate, it is\nindicated if there is suboptimal response to anti-thyroid medication or radio-\niodine.\nAnti-thyroid medication has a slight increased risk of baby developing structural\nabnormalities, so it is common for physicians to encourage patients to choose to\nhave definitive treatment of Grave’s disease with radioactive iodine or surgery\nbefore considering a pregnancy. But then again, a trial of anti-thyroid medication\nis likely to be attempted first.\nIt is also important to note that the patient has symptoms of Graves’s\nophthalmopathy of which radioactive iodine should not be used as part of the\nmanagement. There is evidence that Graves’s ophthalmopathy worsens after\nadministration of radioactive iodine.\nPre-pregnancy counselling is also important. It should include informing the\npatient of the importance of euthyroidism before conception since uncontrolled\nhyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of congenital abnormalities.\nIf the patient was already pregnant, the decision to pick propylthiouracil becomes\nmore\nclear. Also, points to note if the patient is pregnant are as follows:\n• The use of iodides and radioiodine is contraindicated in pregnancy\n• Patient still needs to continue taking anti-thyroid medication during\npregnancy\no As anti-thyroid medication is able to cross the placenta, the lowest\npossible dose should be prescribed\n• If already on carbimazole, change carbimazole to propylthiouracil\n• Thyroidectomy is rarely performed in pregnancy\no It is reserved for patients not responding to anti-thyroid medication\no If necessary, it is preferable to perform thyroidectomy in the second\ntrimester",

  "question": "A 65 year old female was admitted to the hospital with a severe community\nacquired right lower lobe pneumonia as seen on a chest x-ray. Treatment\nwas commenced with 1.2 g of co-amoxiclave intravenously. On the fourth\nday, her skin, sclerae and mucosae were noted to be yellow in colour and it\nwas also observed that she was passing dark urine. The patient’s vitals\nwere noted as follows:\nBlood pressure 120/80 mmHg\nHeart rate 80 beats per minute\nRespiratory rate 30 breaths per min\nA liver function test was subsequently done and the results are shown as\nfollows:\nBilirubin 65 micromol/L (3-17 micromol/L)\nAspartate transaminase (AST) 1500 IU/L (5-35 IU/L)\nAlanine transferase (ALT) 1850 (5-35 IU/L)\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) 290 IU/L (30-130 IU/L)\nThe patient’s past medical history is significant for her drinking around 20\nunits of alcohol per week for the last ten years.

  "choice_c": "Biliary artery stenosis",
  "choice_d": "Viral hepatitis",
  "choice_e": "Drug-induced hepatitis",
  "answer": "Drug-induced hepatitis",
  "explanation": "The scenario depicted here describes a typical presentation of drug-induced\nhepatitis. As is clear from the stem, this patient was treated with intravenous\nantibiotics due to a severe community acquired pneumonia. It is essential to\nremember that co-amoxiclave (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) delivered in high\ntherapeutic doses may induce cholestasis in patients who are already\nsusceptible to liver damage as it is metabolised mainly in the liver. Therefore to\nanswer this question correctly, it is important to know about the laboratory\nchanges in different types of liver diseases.\nElevated bilirubin, and massive elevations of ALP and AST are seen in drug-\ninduced hepatitis. In this patient, it has likely developed due to impaired hepatic\nexcretion (cholestasis) because of the high hepatic toxicity of clavulanic acid that\nis present in co-amoxiclave. Drug-induced liver impairment is less likely to\ndevelop in healthy patients. It has likely occurred here because this patient has a\nhistory of prolonged alcohol intake and this patient’s alcohol intake is a\npredisposing factor for a drug-induced hepatitis.",

Firstly,\npotassium may be lost with vomitus. Secondly, metabolic alkalosis would be\npresent due to excretion of hydrochloric acid with vomitus and state of volume\ndepletion which would additionally cause a loss of potassium through the renal\nsystem via aldosterone-mediated mechanisms.\nAnother reason for hypokaleimia is that he is a chronic alcoholic.\nMany patients with potassium deficiency are also magnesium deficient. So if the\npotassium was very low, a magnesium level should be ordered. He would also\nrequire an ECG, replacement of potassium, and a cardiac monitor as cardiac\narrhythmias are the most serious emergency due to hypokaleimia.

  "answer": "10 units of insulin and 50 ml of 50% glucose infusion",
  "explanation": "The most significant point to highlight in this case is his potassium levels. His\npotassium levels are high enough to cause a life-threatening arrhythmia. The\nhigh levels of potassium could be due to many reasons but it is likely that he is\nsuffering from acute kidney injury due to heart failure causing low blood volumes.\nThe hyperkalaemia needs to be addressed first to prevent cardiac arrest.\nShifting potassium intracellularly is a useful holding measure in life threatening\nhyperkalaemia. This can be done quickly by administering Insulin Actrapid® 10\nunits in 50 mL of Glucose 50% intravenously over 30 minutes via a volumetric\npump. Insulin stimulates cellular uptake of potassium, so it drops serum\npotassium levels rapidly, and glucose is given with insulin to prevent\nhypoglycemia. This would reduce serum potassium levels by 0.65 - 1.0mmol/L\nbut the reduction only last for about an hour. This is usually followed by\nmonitoring blood glucose after 15 minutes, 30 minutes and then hourly for up to 6\nhours as there is a risk of late hypoglycaemia. Again this regimen would differ\ndepending on your local hospital guideline for hyperkalaemia. Just remember\nthat capillary blood glucose needs to be checked before, during and after insulin-\nglucose infusion.\nOther methods that can be used to treat life threatening hyperkalaemia include:\n10-20 mg nebulised salbutamol - this reduces serum potassium (0.5-1.0 mmol/L)\nin 15-30 minutes and lasts for two hours\nIt is also important to check potassium 30 minutes afterwards and if there is a\ngood response, check U&E 1-2 hours later.\nIt is important to remember that shifting potassium intracellularly to treat life\nthreatening hyperkalaemia does not reduce total body potassium, and after two\nto six hours, there is an efflux of potassium back out into the extracellular space\nresulting in serum levels as high or sometimes even higher than at the outset.\nTherefore, any of the steps mentioned must be combined with attempting to\nreduce total body potassium. This can be done by:\n• Avoiding medications which can raise potassium\n• Promote urinary potassium loss\no Intravenous normal saline as long as the patient is not significantly\noverloaded (In this stem, you would not be giving IV fluids as he has\nheart failure and is clearly fluid overloaded given his clinical features of\ncrackles at both lung bases and sacral oedema on palpation)\no If well hydrated consider starting or increasing the dose of a loop diuretic.\n• Remove excess potassium\no Calcium Resonium® has a slow onset of action (at least 2-6 hours) (This\nis the reason it is not the answer in this question. The action to correct\nhyperkalaemia is too slow. Calcium Resonium® has no role in an acute\nsituation)\n• Dialysis\no This is useful if all the above measures have been done and the patient\nstill has high serum potassium\no Note: Dialysis is also likely to be needed if potassium is very high ( >7.5\nmmol/L) or patient is oligo or anuric. In this question, if dialysis was\npresent, it would be a better option to pick rather than insulin-glucose\ninfusion because this patient is having acute renal failure and is anuric. If\nhaemodialysis is performed within 15-30 minutes then treatments to\nmove potassium into cells are unlikely to be helpful and may make\npotassium removal on dialysis more difficult.\nSodium bicarbonate may be useful in the setting of resistant hyperkalaemia\nwith acidosis. It should only be considered if pH is < 7.2. The use of sodium\nbicarbonate is controversial in patients with acidosis and there is still insufficient\nevidence to justify routine use. It is therefore likely to always be the WRONG\nanswer in the PLAB part 1 test in the context of hyperkalaemia.\nIf intravenous calcium gluconate was in one of the options, that would also be a\ncorrect answer because it is needed to stabilise the cardiac membrane to prevent\narrhythmias. Intravenous calcium has rapid effects, resulting in improvement of\nECG abnormalities within minutes of administration",

  "answer": "IV calcium chloride",
  "explanation": "There is clear derangment of his electrolytes but what is important to know is to\ntreat the hyperkaleimia first as levels higher than 6 with ECG changes can be life\nthreatening. His hyperkaleimia is probably secondary to an acute kidney injury\nwhich can be seen with a low eGFR. He would require intravenous fluids but the\nmost important part of management now is intravenous calcium chloride (or\ncalcium gluconate) and cardiac monitoring.\nThe slightly elevated calcium and low magnesium can be managed after\nstabilising the cardiac membrane with calcium chloride or calcium gluconate.\nNebulized salbutamol has a role in lowering potassium quickly and can lower\npotassium levels by 1 mmol/L in about 30 minutes and maintain it for up to 2\nhours however in moderate hyperkaleimia such as in this stem (values of 6.0-6.5\nmmol/L), salbutamol nebulisers may be considered but calcium chloride (or\ncalcium gluconate) is a must.\nOften salbutamol nebulisers, calcium chloride, intravenous insulin with dextrose\nare all prescribed at the same time, but if one was to choose, pick intravenous\ncalcium chloride (or calcium gluconate).",

  "choice_d": "Autoimmune",
  "choice_e": "Medication",

  "explanation": "The patient has presented with the classic symptoms of Addison’s disease. This\ndescribes an inability of the adrenal glands to produce sufficient steroid\nhormones. The most common cause of adrenal insufficiency in the UK is\nautoimmune in nature (85% of cases). Other causes include surgical removal of\nthe adrenal glands, injury, infections (of which TB is the commonest cause\nworldwide), haemorrhage and infarction.\nThe most common feature of Addison’s disease is fatigue and weakness.\nPatients also complain of dizziness and vertigo – this is due to postural\nhypotension. Aldosterone helps maintain blood pressure and salt and water\nhomeostasis in the body by helping the kidneys to retain sodium and excrete\npotassium. In adrenal insufficiency, the levels of aldosterone fall so low that the\nkidneys are unable to regulate water and salt balance, leading to a drop in both\nblood volume and blood pressure.\nFor the exam, it is important to remember that the definitive investigative test to\nconfirm Addison’s disease is the ACTH stimulation (Synacthen®) test\nMineralocorticoid replacement is required in this patient. Fludricortisone is\nusually used.",

  "explanation": "The method to answer this question is by going thruogh the answers one by one.\nNICE recommends biguanide (such as metformin) as first line treatment for\npatietns with type 2 diabetes unless this is contraindicated. Contraindictions to\nmetformin include eGFR less than 30 ml/min which is seen in this stem.\nSulphonylurea should not be used in renal impairment as there is a risk of\nhypoglycaemia. Furthermore, this patient has a high BMI. Sulphonylurea are\nknown to cause weight gain which would not be suitable for this patient.\nDPP-4 inhibitors are suitable choices amongst the options. They are weight\nneutral and would not cause weight gain.\nAlpha glucosidase inhibitor such as acarbose are used when other oral glucose-\nlowering medications cannot be used. It works by delaying absorption and\ndigestion of sucrose and starch. Since we could potentially use DPP-4 inhibitors\nwhich is considered second line, alpha glucosidase inhibitors would be wrong\nanswer.",

One litre of sodium\nchloride\n0.9% contains:\n• 154 mEq of sodium ion = 154 mmol/L\n• 154 mEq of chloride ion = 154 mmol/L\nThus, sodium chloride 0.9% intravenous infusion can be used to treat sodium\ndepletion\nand in this case it will correct the electrolyte disbalance. Potassium levels will\nalso be\nbrought down slightly with sodium chloride 0.9% intravenous infusion.\nNebulised salbutamol, insulin-glucose intravenous infusion and sodium\nbicarbonate are\nused in the management of moderate to severe hyperkalaemia (usually with\npotassium\nvalues ranging from above 6 mmol/L)\nELECTROLYTE CONSTITUENTS OF FREQUENTLY USED INTRAVENOUS\nFLUIDS\nIt is important to have an idea of the electrolyte composition in each fluid bag\nprescriebd so that we can prescribe the appropriate fluids in certain group of\npatients with electrolyte disbalances.\nNa (mmol/L) K (mmol/L) Cl (mmol/L)\n0.9% Normal saline 154 0/20/40 154\nHartmann’s 131 5 111\n5% glucose 0 0/20/40 0\nA simple example:\nIf an elderly patient’s sodium level is 131 mmol/L and he requires intravenous\nfluids as he looks clinically dehydrated, 0.9% normal saline would be a better\noption than Hartmann’s as this would help increase his sodium levels.",

Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) analysis is performed on a single\nspot from the initial dried blood sample. Screening for congenital hypothyroidism\nis part of the newborn blood spot test which is offered when baby is 6 to 8 weeks\nold. So it would be unlikely that a congenital hypothyroidism would go\nundiagnosed until the 8 month of life.\nThe reason for the family history of prolonged neonatal jaundice is because 15%\nof congenital hypothyroidism is caused by thyroid dyshormonogenesis defects\ntransmitted by an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Thyroid hormone\ndysgenesis is caused by inborn errors of thyroid metabolism.\nCongenital hypothyroidism\nClinical features\n• Physiological jaundice\n• Goitre\n• Feeding problems, constipation\n• Delay in reaching normal milestones of development, short stature\n• Coarse features with protruding tongue, broad flat nose, widely set eyes\n• Sparse hair and dry skin\n• Impaired mental development",

Irrigation with water is contra-indicated for soft\nobjects, organic matter or seeds (which may swell and increase the level of pain and\ndifficulty to remove if exposed to water).\nRemoval by hook is not suitable if the child is uncooperative.\nOlive oil only works for ear wax or used to float an insect out by pouring olive oil into the\near.\nGeneral anaesthesia to remove the foreign object is usually needed in this sort of\nscenario. This is to avoid injury.\nReferral to an ear, nose and throat specialist\nReferral is indicated in the following:\n• If the patient requires sedation\n• If there is any difficulty in removing the foreign body\n• If the patient is unco-operative.\n• If the tympanic membrane has been perforated.\n• If an adhesive is in contact with the tympanic membrane.\nForeign objects in the ear is a very commonly asked question in PLAB.

  "answer": "Functional dysphonia",
  "explanation": "Functional dysphonia refers to a voice disturbance that occurs in the absence of any\nstructural abnormality of the larynx or any cord paralysis. It is a diagnosis of exclusion.\nSymptoms include vocal fatigue (voice becoming worse with use) and laryngeal\ndiscomfort. There may be various interacting causes, such as heavy demands on the\nvoice, poor vocal technique and stress.\nThe case given above gives a history of voice overuse. This is a common problem in\nsome occupations such as acting and teaching. It may also follow unaccustomed voice\nuse, such as shouting at a football match. Vocal strain may be exacerbated when\nattempting to compensate for an acute respiratory infection. Given that there is no\noption to pick voice overuse and since there is no structural or neurological pathology,\nfunctional dysphonia is the best option.\nRecurrent laryngeal nerve palsy mainly presents with voice changes as well but there is\nusually an obvious cause like trauma during surgery (especially thyroid surgery), tumour\nspread, bulbar palsy, or penetrating wounds none of which was mentioned in this stem.\nAngioedema in severe cases can cause hoarseness but it also presents with difficulty in\nbreathing which is not the case here.\nLaryngeal obstruction like angioedema would have difficulty in breathing.\nLaryngitis would have been the best option provided that the hoarseness of voice\noccurred during the respiratory infection prior to treatment. Since the hoarseness of\nvoice occurred post treatment, it is unlikely to be laryngitis.",

Vestibular\nneuritis follows a viral infection and can cause vertigo, nausea and vomiting on the\nmovement of the head.\nVestibular neuritis\nDevelops over hours and resolves in days.

  "question": "A 26 year old woman has become aware of an increasing right-sided hearing loss\nsince her last pregnancy. On otoscopy, her eardrums look normal. Her hearing\ntests show bone conduction (BC) is better than air conduction (AC) in the right\near. Weber’s test lateralizes to the right ear. What is the SINGLE most likely\ndiagnosis?",
  "choice_a": "Encephalopathy",
  "choice_b": "Functional hearing loss",
  "choice_c": "Tympanosclerosis",
  "choice_d": "Otosclerosis",
  "choice_e": "Sensorineural deafness",
  "answer": "Otosclerosis",
  "explanation": "Weber’s test lateralized to the right and bone conduction is better than air conductionon\nthe right. This clearly shows a conductive deafness on the right. There are no features\nof encephalopathy. Tympanosclerosis has characteristic chalky white patches seen on\ninspection of the eardrum. Since the eardrum here was viewed as normal, it is unlikely\nto be tympanosclerosis.\nThe only answer left would be otosclerosis. Bone and air conduction must be tested\nand in otosclerosis it typically reveals a purely conductive, predominantly low-tone loss.\nOther hints in this stem are:\n• Female gender – otosclerosis usually occurs in females (2:1 female:male ratio)\n• Pregnancy – pregnancy accelerates the progression of osteosclerosis\nRinne's and Weber's test\nPerforming both Rinne's and Weber's test allows differentiation of conductive and\nsensorineural deafness.\nRinne's test\nA tuning fork is placed over the mastoid process until the sound is no longer heard,\nfollowed by repositioning just over external acoustic meatus\n• Note that air conduction (AC) is normally better than bone conduction (BC) (Positive\nRinne's test)\n• If BC > AC, then the patient has conductive deafness (Negative Rinne’s test)\n• (Abnormal Rinne’s test)\nNote that the words positive and negative are used in a somewhat confusing fashion\nhere, as compared to their normal use in medical tests. Positive or negative in this case\nmeans that a certain parameter that was evaluated was present or not. In this case, that\nparameter is whether air conduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC).\nThus, a \"positive\" result indicates the healthy state, in contrast to many other medical\ntests. Therefore, some prefer to avoid using the term 'positive' or 'negative', and simply\nstate if the test was normal or abnormal e.g. 'Rinne's test was abnormal in the right ear,\nwith bone conduction greater than air conduction'.\nWeber's test\nA tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead equidistant from the patient's ears.\nThe patient is then asked which side is loudest\n• If sound is localised to the unaffected side, then this is unilateral sensorineural\ndeafness\n• If sound is localised to the affected side, then this is unilateral conductive deafness\nExample\nIf Weber’s test localises to the right side. It can either be right conductive deafness OR\nleft sensorineural deafness. A Rinne’s test would be able to confirm if it is a right\nconductive deafness.\nOTOSCLEROSIS\nIn otosclerosis, there is a pathological increased bony turnover leading to sclerosis and\nfailure of the sound conduction mechanism. This is due to ankylosis of the stapes\nfootplate in the fenestra ovalis of the cochlea. This reduces normal sound transmission\nresulting in a conductive deafness.\nOtosclerosis is the commonest cause of progressive deafness in young adults. It\nusually presents between 15 and 45 years of age.\nGenetic factors are involved, so the condition often (but not always) runs in families.\nThe family history is especially important to note as it is commonly given in the stem if\nthe question writers want you to pick otosclerosis.\nIt is bilateral in 80% of cases, although it is not uncommon for one ear to be worse than\nthe other.\nUntreated, the deafness gradually worsens. Other symptoms of otosclerosis include\ntinnitus and vertigo.\nIt is progressive and there is no curative treatment at the moment. The management\ninvolves either surgery (stapedectomy or stapedotomy, with the insertin of a prosthesis)\nor bilateral hearing aids for those not fit for surgery.\nKey features for otosclerosis:\n• Main symptoms are progressive hearing loss and tinnitus\n• Majority of the time it is bilateral\n• Conductive hearing loss (where the cochlea is involved there may be a mixed\nconductive/sensory pattern of hearing loss)\n• A family history of hearing loss",

  "explanation": "The diagnosis can be seen with the examination of the ear. A red tympanic membrane\nthat is bulging is classical for otitis media. We know that the membrane is bulging\nbecause there is a loss of light reflex. The light reflex (cone of light) is seen as a cone-\nshaped reflection in the anterior inferior quadrant of the tympanic membrane. The\nabsence of the light reflex occurs when there is a distortion of the shape of the tympanic\nmembrane such as a bulging membrane due to an increase of inner ear pressure seen\nin otitis media.\nAcute otitis media in children\nAcute otitis media is acute inflammation of the middle ear and may be caused by\nbacteria or viruses.\nFeatures\n• Rapid onset of pain (younger children may pull at the ear)\n• Fever\n• Irritability\n• Coryza\n• Vomiting\n• Often after a viral upper respiratory infection\n• A red, yellow or cloudy tympanic membrane or bulging of the tympanic membrane.\n• An air-fluid level behind the tympanic membrane\n• Discharge in the auditory canal secondary to perforation of the tympanic membrane\n• Perforation of the eardrum often relieves pain. This is because bulging of the\ntympanic membrane causes the pain.\nOTITIS MEDIA VS OTITIS EXTERNA\nOtitis media Otitis externa\nRisk factors • Younger age • Swimming\n• High environmental humidity\nFeatures • May be seen with a bulging • Serous discharge\ntympanic membrane without • Starts with an itch followed by\ndischarge or purulent discharge pain.\nwith a ruptured tympanic\nmembrane\n• Starts with pain in the ear\nfollowed by a popping sensation\nof the ear with complete\nresolution of pain.

  "question": "A 33 year old tennis player has to stop playing tennis competetively because she\nhas recurrent vertigo attacks every time she plays tennis. The vertigo attacks\nstarted after a history of a runny nose, cough and fever. Her hearing is not\naffected. What is the SINGLE most likely diagnosis?",
  "choice_a": "Acoustic neuroma",
  "choice_b": "Meniere’s disease",
  "choice_c": "Labyrinthitis",
  "choice_d": "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo",
  "choice_e": "Vestibular neuritis",
  "answer": "Vestibular neuritis",
  "explanation": "This may sound like benign paroxysmal positional vertigo but because of the history of\nrunny nose, cough and fever, it is more likely to be vestibular neuritis. Vestibular\nneuritis follows a viral infection and can cause vertigo, nausea and vomiting on\nmovement of the head.\nVestibular neuritis\nDevelops over hours and resolves in days. Usually followed by a viral infection. Strictly\nspeaking the term means inflammation of the vestibular nerve but the aetiology is\nthought to be a vestibular neuropathy.\nPresentation\n• Onset is usually very abrupt\n• Recurrent vertigo attacks lasting hours or days\n• Unsteadiness, nausea and vomiting (feel as if the room is rotating)\n• Moving the head aggravates symptoms\nNote: Labyrinthitis is a similar syndrome to vestibular neuritis, but with the addition of\nhearing symptoms (sensory type hearing loss or tinnitus). There is no hearing loss with\nvestibular neuritis.\nCOMPARING VESTIBULAR NEURITIS AND LABYRINTHITIS\nVestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis have many similar symptoms and are sometimes\nused interchangeably however, strictly speaking, vestibular neuritis is the inflammation\nof the vestibular nerve whereas labyrinthitis involves vestibular nerve and the labyrinth.\nBoth produce vertigo and nystagmus however labyrinthitis has hearing loss and tinnitus\nwhich is not a feature of vestibular neuritis.",

  "explanation": "AC > BC indicates Rinne positive (i.e. deafness is not conductive). It is important to note\nthat the hearing loss is on right side. Weber lateralized to left. Weber lateralizes to the\nsame side if there is conductive deafness and to opposite if there is sensorineural\ndeafness. It is quite obvious that the deafness of right ear is sensorineural deafness for\nwhich magnetic resonance imaging brain is the next best investigation.\nSensorineural hearing loss refers to problems occurring in the cochlea, cochlear nerve\nor brain stem, resulting in abnormal or absent neurosensory impulses. MRI scan can be\nused to identify gross structural causes of hearing loss. They are useful in cases where\na tumour is suspected or to determine the degree of damage in a hearing loss caused\nby bacterial infection or auto-immune disease.",

  "answer": "Automated auditory brainstem (AABR)",
  "explanation": "Hearing screening is offered to all babies in England within 4 to 5 weeks of birth.\nBabies who were born in the hospital are normally given a newborn hearing test before\nthey are discharged otherwise it would be done in the first few weeks of life by a health\nvisitor.\nThe hearing screening programme offers 2 types of test:\n• Automated otoacoustic emission (AOAE)\n• Automated auditory brainstem response\nAutomated otoacoustic emission (AOAE) test takes a few minutes. A soft-tipped\nearpiece is placed in the newborn’s ear and clicking sounds are played. Vibration of the\nhair cells in response to noise generates acoustic energy which is detected by a\nmicrophone in the external meatus. If AOAE test is performed and there is no clear\nresponse in one or both eares, then the automated auditory brainstem response\n(AABR) test is performed.\nThe AABR test involves placing 3 electrodes on the infant’s forehead and neck.\nClicking sounds are then played. The electrodes would measure brain wave activity in\nresponse to the clicks.\nGiven that AOAE test is not even an option in this question, the next most appropriate\nanswer would be the AABR test. AABR also has the benefit of detecting auditory\nneuropathy in children who are deaf but have normal otoacoustic emissions (i.e. in\nthose who have a normal cochlea).",

Speech\nhas two components: vowels which are low-frequencies and consonants which are\nhigh-frequencies. When the high-frequency sounds are lost, consonants are lost, which\nresults in difficulty in understanding speech.\n“Don’t shout, I’m not deaf!’ is a common phrase used by elderly patients suffering from\npresbyacusis. Shouting words to them would only increase the low-frequency sounds\nand not the high-frequency sounds.\nThe management includes using hearing aids that increase the high-frequency sound.\nIn the UK, the NHS uses bilateral digital hearing aids.\nOtosclerosis is a distractor. It usually occurs at an earlier age. Otosclerosis is a\nconductive hearing loss and more importantly, the affected individual would report better\nhearing when in noisy environments which is an opposite finding from presbyacusis.\nPRESBYACUSIS\nPresbyacusis, also known as age-related sensorineural hearing loss is the most\ncommon cause of hearing impairement in elderly patients.

Cohort studies are purely observational and may be\nprospective (going forward in time) or retrospective (happened in the past). Because\nthese studies are observational, the researchers (like in case-control studies) do not\nintervene with the groups of people. Example of a prospective cohort study, group A\nare patients who smoke, group B are patients who do not smoke. They are followed in\ntime to determine who develops lung cancer.\nWhat is the difference between a case-control study and a retrospective cohort study?\nIn case-control, one starts with the outcomes andstudies the exposure. In retrospective\ncohort studies, one already has determined the exposure, but now needs to study the\nassociation of exposure to disease outcome.\nRandomised controlled clinical trial. These are experiments that introduce a\ntreatment or exposure to study its effect on real patients. It usually compares an active\ngroup with a control group and employs methods such as randomisation and blinding to\nreduce bias. Typically, new drugs are tested this way. Example, a group of patients\nwith disease X who meet specific criteria, are randomly allocated to receive either the\nexperimental treatment or the control treatment (either the standard treatement for\ndisease X or a placebo). Both groups are then followed in time, and the outcomes are\nobserved.\nCross-sectional study. This is a study that describes the relationship between\ndiseases and other factors at one point in time in a defined population. They are often\nused for comparing diagnostic tests. A good example would be researches performing\na survey on a population to detemine the relationship between increased levels of\nserum cholesterol and electrocardiographic evidence of coronary artery disease. Both\nthe exposure and the disease outcome are taken at the same point of time. It is like a\nsnapshot of a population at a specific time.\nSystemic review. This focuses on a clinical topic and answers a specific question that\narises.\nMeta-analysis. This is a study that examines a number of studies on a topic and\nmathematically combines the results to report the results as if it were one large study.",

  "explanation": "Risk ratios are an important topic in PLAB as it is one of the main epidemiologic\nquestions asked.\nAbsolute risk (AR) of a disease is your risk of developing the disease over a time\nperiod. The same absolute risk can be expressed in different ways. For example, say\nyou have a 1 in 10 risk of developing a certain disease in your life. This can also be\nsaid to be a 10% risk, or a 0.1 risk – depending on whether you use percentages or\ndecimals.\nRelative risk (RR) is used to compare the risk in two different groups of people. For\nexample, consider the risk for blindness in a patient with diabetes over a 5-year period.\nIf the risk for blindness is 4 in 100 (4%) in a group of patients treated conventionally\n(control group) and 3 in 100 (3%) in patients treated with a new drug (experimental\ngroup), the relative risk is the ratio of the two risks. Given the data above, the relative\nrisk is:\n3% ÷ 4% = 75% (or 0.75)\nExpressed as a relative difference, the new drug reduces the risk for blindness by a\nquarter.\nAn RR of < 1 means the event is less likely to occur in the experimental group than in\nthe control group.\nAn RR of > 1 means the event is more likely to occur in the experimental group than in\nthe control group.\nA good formula to remember for PLAB part 1 is:\nRR = risk of disease in exposed / risk of disease in unexposed\nIn this scenario, it would be:\nRR = risk of blindness in diabetics taking new drug / risk of blindness in diabetics with\nno drug",

  "choice_c": "Failure of the active drug",
  "choice_d": "Insufficient information to interpret data",
  "choice_e": "An initial randomisation error.",
  "answer": "Breakdown of the double-blind study",
  "explanation": "For some questions such as this, it is necessary to select an answer based on the\nprocess of elimination.\nFailure of the active drug is incorrect seeing as how a more significant percentage of the\nplacebo group withdrew.\nInsufficient information to interpret data occurs when researchers do not have sufficient\nresults to analyse the study.\nChance even in this context means that a specific cause cannot explain the people’s\nwithdrawal i.e. the dropout was by chance. The issue with this statement is the massive\ndiscrepancy in dropouts of the placebo group compared to the experimental group. An\nacceptable dropout rate between groups is considered to be less than 15%. Here we\nsee a drop out rate difference of 22%. Furthermore, we would expect a dropout rate to\nbe small given that the study is only for one year. A study of 10 years may have a\ndropout rate difference of 20% to 25% which is acceptable because patients are often\nlost to follow up as it is such a lengthy study. Dropouts not related to systemic bias\ncould occur due to an unrelated illness, death, or job relocation. That being said, a\nstudy that only lasts for one year should have dropout rates that are near to zero for it to\nbe considered a chance event.\nAn initial randomisation error is a possibility although the stem gives no information as\nto how the patients were selected. If methodologies were not appropriate, it could lead\nto bias and compromise the study.\nThe best answer is that there is a breakdown of the double-blind study. A breakdown in\nthe study can occur if people from either group find out that they are in the experimental\ngroup or the control group. Patients in the placebo group may have found that they\nhave been taking placebo medication and hence decided to leave. This would result in\na very high percentage of people in the placebo group leaving which is precisely what\nwe see in this case.",

  "explanation": "At 16 it is legally presumed that young people have the ability to make decisions about\ntheir own care. Note that even children under 16 may have the capacity to consent\nprovided they have the maturity to do so. In this case, the parents are refusing\ntreatment that is clearly in the best interests of a child. It is clear that the child has the\nmaturity and ability to understand what is involved and he is of good age to give\nconsent.\nCapacity to consent\nThe capacity to consent depends more on young people’s ability to understand and\nweigh up options than on age. When assessing a young person’s capacity to consent,\nyou should bear in mind that:\n- At 16 a young person can be presumed to have the capacity to consent\n- A young person under 16 may have the capacity to consent, depending on their\nmaturity and ability to understand what is involved.\nRespect for young people’s views is important in making decisions about their care. If\nthey refuse treatment, particularly treatment that could save their life or prevent serious\ndeterioration in their health, this presents a challenge that you need to consider carefully\nParents cannot override the competent consent of a young person to treatment that you\nconsider is in their best interests. But you can rely on parental consent when a child\nlacks the capacity to consent. In Scotland parents cannot authorise treatment a\ncompetent young person has refused. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the law\non parents overriding young people’s competent refusal is complex. You should seek\nlegal advice if you think treatment is in the best interests of a competent young person\nwho refuses.\nNote that the ability to consent changes if you are under 13. By law children under 13\nare considered unable to consent.",

  "answer": "Contact social services and explore their concerns",
  "explanation": "The topic of consent is extremely important for the PLAB exam as well as practice in the\nNHS. In terms of U.K law, a person aged 16 and upward is generally considered to\nhave capacity and is able to consent for their own medical procedures. A child is also\nable to consent provided they are competent in understanding the situation. This is\ncalled Gillick competence. In the above situation, the best choice is to contact social\nservices and assess the boy’s capacity to make his own decision. Surgery is a major\nprocedure and this child should not be subject to undergo a potentially life-threatening\nprocedure that he doesn’t need just because his caregiver wishes him to.\nScheduling the surgery as his consent is not needed would be the correct answer IF this\nwas an emergency procedure that the child needed in order to survive. In those\nconditions, parental consent would overrule the child’s wishes as the procedure would\nbe in the best interests of the child.\nNot performing the surgery since the boy has not given consent cannot be chosen\nblindly without exploring whether the child has capacity or not. A safe answer for PLAB\nexam ethics questions is always discussing and exploring patient concerns.",

In this stem, it is unclear\nif providing information to the police would in any way protect the public.\nThe GMC clearly states that when the police arrive, doctors should not allow them to\naccess the patient if this will delay or hamper the treatment or compromise the patient’s\nrecovery. The background history in this question, does not show any evidence that by\nlettingthe police speak to this patient, it will directly compromise his recovery or delay\ntreatment. It is therefore appropriate to allow the police to access the patient however\none needs to obtain the patient’s permission to do so.\nThe GMC states that\nIf the patient’s treatment and condition allow them to speak to the police, you or another\nmember of the healthcare team should ask the patient whether they are willing to do so.\nIf they are not, you, the rest of the healthcare team, and the police must abide by the\npatient’s decision.”\nSo the first step here is to ask the patient’s permission.\nGunshot and knife wounds need to be reported to police as it is the duty of the police to\nassess the risk of someone who has used, a gun or a knife in a fight. Please note that\nalthough personal information, such as the patient’s name and address, should be\ngiven, it should not usually be disclosed in the initial contact with the police.\nRemember, you should ask for the patient’s consent before disclosing any personal\ninformation.

An overriding public interest constitutes\na serious communicable illness such as tuberculosis or other notifiable disease. A HIV\npositive patient may not need to reveal his diagnosis to the GP. He may obtain his anti-\nviral treatments from the GUM clinic.\nThe GMC’s guidance on disclosing information is very clear and says that while\nhealthcare workers are also entitled to protection against harm and diseases, disclosure\nabout a patient’s infection status is unlikely to be justified if disclosing a patient’s\ninfection status makes no difference to the risk of transmission. In this case, all\nhealthcare workers involved in the treatment of this patient would be following universal\nprecautions anyway so the disclosure of this patient’s HIV status would make no\ndifference to the risk of transmission from this patient.

  "explanation": "The GMC has very clear guidelines on what to do in scenarios in which determining\ncapacity is not straightforward. Above all, you must always seek to do what is in the\npatient’s best interests. This may seem counter-intuitive as you will not be resuscitating\nthis patient despite the daughter’s wishes however, this is the correct answer.\nA Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order means that a health care personnel is not required to\nresuscitate a patient if they go into cardiopulmonary arrest. The idea of a DNR is to\nprevent any unnecessary suffering. Remember that resuscitation is traumatic and can\ncause broken ribs and a ruptured spleen so one needs to consider the patient’s qualty\nof life if he or she would survive the resuscitation.\nIn most cases, a DNR order is issued after discussing the potential risk with the patient\nor their families however in many circumstances, it is more complex than just that.\nThe law allows DNR to be issued in the following circumstances\n• If a patient’s condition issuch that resuscitation is unlikely to succeed\n• If a patient, with capacity, asks not to be resuscitated. Respect their decision!\n• If there is advanced notice or a living will whichsays the patient does not want to be\nresuscitated\n• If successful resuscitationwould not be in the patient’s best interest because it would\nlead to a poor quality of life\nAlthough a DNR falls under the decision of doctors, it is very important to involve the\npatient and their families. It is not appropriate to make a DNR decision without the\npatient’s knowledge. There are many cases of this scenario in the UK where patients\nhave found a DNR order written by her medical team without the patient’s knowledge.\nThis could be very well be asked during the exam.\nKey point to remember here is that the law does not require a patient, or their family to\nconsent to a DNR order nonetheless it is important to involve them. This means doctors\ncan issue a DNR order even if the patient does not want it.\nRemember, patients have no right to demand that a healthcare professional provides\nCPR if the doctor deems that CPR would be unsuccessful or not in the patient’s best\ninterest.",

  "choice_d": "Her granddaughter is her caretaker and therefore can consent for her",
  "choice_e": "Allow her to change her will after 3 months",
  "answer": "Refer for assessment of capacity",
  "explanation": "Referring the patient for assessment of her capacity is the best possible choice out of\nthe given choices. A safe answer for PLAB 1 exam ethics questions is always\ndiscussing and exploring patient concerns.\nAllowing her to change her will would be the correct choice if she wasn’t diagnosed with\nAlzheimer’s disease. Patient autonomy is the founding principal of U.K medical practice\nand we should always endeavor to maintain patient autonomy at all times.\nRefusing her to change her will is the incorrect choice because without an evaluation of\nwhether she has capacity or not, this would be a violation of the U.K code of ethics.\nThere was no mention in the stem that her granddaughter is indeed her caretaker, and\neven if her granddaughter was her caretaker, important decisions that impact on the\npatient cannot be undertaken by a caretaker without a power of attorney document\n(which also was not mentioned in the stem).\nThe Mental Capacity Act of 2005 seeks to empower and protect people who may not\nbe able to make some decisions for themselves. It also enables people to plan ahead in\ncase they are unable to make important decisions for themselves in the future. The law\nworks on the principle that everyone is assumed to have capacity to make decisions for\nthemselves if they are given enough information, support and time. It protects their right\nto make their own decisions and to be involved in any decisions that affect them. A\nperson's capacity must be judged according to the specific decision that need to be\nmade, and not solely because of their illness, disability, age, appearance or behaviour.\nAn important principle in the law is that just because someone is making what seems to\nbe an unwise decision (even if they have an illness or disability) this does not\nnecessarily mean they lack capacity.",

With large age discrepancy\nbetween the teenager and her partner, the concern is the possibility of child abuse or\nexploitation\nIf her sexual partner was of similar age, example 15 years old, and she had the maturity\nto understand the advice and its implications, you should then advise them about safe\nsex, prescribe the COCP and do not breach confidentiality.\nThe age discrepancy between the girl and her boyfriend, under GMC guidelines, is seen\nas the boyfriend being able to be of greater influence and power over the girl. As such,\nthis would be considered a case of sexual abuse and needs to be reported to social\nservices and the police.\nYou would also provide contraception as requested by the girl as she is of mental\ncapacity to make an informed decision over treatment and under GMC guidelines, you\nwould not be obligated to inform or gain consent from her parents for doing so.\nHowever, you would advise the girl that it would be in her best interests to discuss with\nher parents.",

  "explanation": "The first step when you suspect a colleague with an issue is to confront them to hear\nthe whole story before judging. It may very well be that someone had spilled alcohol on\nhim that day before he came to work.\nIf his story was likely to be untrue or if you still had concerns about him with the\npossibility that he may be coming to work udner the influence of alcohol, the next step\nwould be to inform your senior doctors in charge. The risk of alcohol consumption prior\nto work coupled with the daily demands of doctor could lead to errors in their clinical\njudgment which could seriously jeopardise patient safety. Your seniors would need to\nknow and to act on this.\nIf you feel that you are unable to raise your concern with an appropriate person like your\nsenior doctor for any reason, or if you do raise it but feel as it has not been acted on\nappropriately, you can consider contacting the GMC directly. The GMC recognises that\ndoctors may be reluctant to report a concern because of the negative effect it may have\non working relationships, however they make it clear that doctors have a duty to put\npatient’s best interests first, and that this overrides personal and professional loyalties.\nIf you are still unsure of your professional obligations or how to approach the situation, it\nwould be a good idea to seek advice from your medical defence organisation.\nConcerns can also be raised with the medical director or clinical governance lead\nresponsible for your organisation.\nRemember with regards to your professional obligations, the GMC has released a\ndetailed guidance in 2012 on ‘Raising and acting on concerns about patient safety’,\nwhich states:\n“All doctors have a duty to raise concerns where they believe that patient safety or care\nis being compromised by the practice of colleagues or the systems, policies, and\nprocedures in the organisations in which they work. They must also encourage and\nsupport a culture in whichstaff can raise concerns openly and safely.”\nIn short, we can summarise one’s actions on how to report a fellow colleague if there\nwere concerns:\nFirst – Confront your colleague\nSecond – Inform seniors\nThird – involve GMC\nIf unsure – seek advince from medical defence organisation",

This is a very good reason why we should always\nstart off with narrow spectrum antibiotics such as trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin for\nsimple urinary tract infections.\nIn the exam, look out for antibiotic usage like cephalosporins, clindamycin, co-\namoxiclav, and amoxicillin as a cause for Clostridium difficile.\nCLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE\nClostridium difficile is a Gram positive rod often encountered in hospital practice. Itis\ntransmitted via the faecal-oral route by spores that are resistant to antibiotics. It\nproduces an exotoxin which causes intestinal damage leading to a syndrome\ncalledpseudomembranous colitis. Clostridium difficile develops when the normal gut\nflora aresuppressed by broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nMost common an tibiotics implicated in Clostridium difficile infections are:\n• Clindamycin\n• Cephalosporins (in particular second and third generation cephalosporins)\n• Quinolones\n• Co-amoxiclav\n• Aminopenicllins (amoxicillin and ampicillin)\nFeatures\n• Diarrhoea - may be mild diarrhoea or serious bloody diarrhoea\n• Abdominal pain – can sometimes be severe enough to mimic an acute abdomen\n• Raised white blood cell count\n• Fever\nDiagnosis\nClostridium difficile toxin (CDT) detected in the stool\nManagement\n• Stop the causative antibiotic (if possible)\n• first-line therapy is oral metronidazole\n• if severe or not responding to metronidazole then oral vancomycin may beused\nAnother method of treating Clostridium difficile is faecal microbial transplantation but we\nshall not discuss this in case you are about to eat lunch.\nNote: Treatment is not usually needed if patient is asymptomatic",

Upon further questioning, he reveals that he opens his bowels in\nexcess of two to six times per day. He describes his stool as being watery in\nconsistency. He has also noticed blood in his stool. When asked about the\ncharacter of the blood, the patient claims that the blood appeared to be fresh and\nwas bright red in colour. He also complains about abdominal pain and describes\nhis pain as being cramping in nature. He complains about an urgency to visit the\ntoilet all the time. The patient is a bank manager by profession and for the last\nseven days, has been unable to cope with his situation. He says that it is\naffecting his work and overall general health as he is feeling very tired and\nlethargic all the time. He also complains about a lack of appetite. He has not\ntraveled outside of the United Kingdom for the last eight months. The patient has\nno significant past medical history and does not have any allergies. On\nexamination, he has a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 70\nbeats/minute. His abdomen is tender with no guarding or rigidity.

  "choice_c": "Faecal antigen test",
  "choice_d": "Faecal blood occult test",
  "choice_e": "Colonoscopy",
  "answer": "Stool microscopy, culture and sensitivity",
  "explanation": "The World Health Organisation classification of diarrhoea is as follows:\n• Diarrhoea > 3 loose or watery stool per day\n• Acute diarrhoea < 14 days\n• Chronic diarrhoea > 14 days\nAccording to the above classification, it is too early to decide in this patient if he is\nsuffering from ulcerative colitis or not because he has had diaarhoea for only the last\nseven days. At this stage, it is best to exclude the infectious causes first by doing a\nstool microscopy, culture and sensitivity test.\nIn such cases, the investigations largely depend on the clinical setting. For example, in\nprimary care the main aim is to make the diagnosis and in secondary care, to confirm\nthe diagnosis as well as to assess the severity and extent of the disease.\nIn primary care, the test must include a stool culture and sensitivity to exclude the\ninfectious causes of diarrhoea such as salmonella, shigella, eschericia coli, clostridium\ndifficile, campylobacter and giardiasis. Once the infectious causes are excluded, further\ndiagnostic tests like colonoscopy with biopsy can be done in secondary care.\nFaecal test is not the correct option. A faecal fat test is primarily ordered when a person\nhas signs and symptoms of malabsorption such as steatorrhea, persistent diarrhoea,\nabdominal pain, bloating, weight loss and failure to thrive (in children)\nThe faecal antigen test is a stool test which is used to detect helicobacter pylori. It is an\nirrelevant test to perform in this particular patient.",

  "choice_c": "Benign oesophageal stricture",
  "choice_d": "Barrett’s Oesophagus",
  "choice_e": "Pharyngeal pouch",
  "answer": "Benign oesophageal stricture",
  "explanation": "Benign oesophageal strictures – are usually the result of scarring from acid reflux in\nsevere and persistent GORD. It may also follow ingestion of corrosives. While the area\nheals, a scar forms, causing the tissue to pull and tighten, leading to difficulty in\nswallowing. Certain drugs like alendronate and NSAIDs have the potential to cause\nstrictures due to their side effects which worsen GORD. This is seen in this stem where\nthe patient is taking alendronate. This is the reason that it is so important to advise\npatients not to lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate as this will help\nalendronate reach the stomach faster and prevent irritation of the oesophagus.\nOesophageal carcinoma – The absence of any significant weight loss makes\noesophageal carcinoma a less likely diagnosis. Although it is important to note that any\ncause of dysphagia can essentially cause weight loss. This includes both benign\noesophageal stricture and achalasia.\nBarrett’s oesophagus – Would also have a long history of gastro-oesophageal reflux\nwhich is seen in this stem however, the symptoms of dysphagia is usually occasional\nrather than persistent.\nPharyngeal pouch – Usually presents with a history of halitosis and regurgitation of\nundigested food, a sensation of a lump on the throat, neck bulge.\nAchalasia – While the most common feature is dysphagia, regurgitation is a very\ncommon feature of achalasia and occurs in around 80-90% of sufferers.\nPlease note that if this stem did not include the history of taking Alendronate, the\nanswer is still likely to be benign oesophageal stricture given that there is less evidence\nfor any other opiton.",

  "explanation": "Acute cholecystitis presents with severe continuous right upper quadrant pain which can\nbe seen to radiate to right flank and back. A fever like in this stem is also associated\nwith it. Nausea and vomiting are often seen with cholecystitis.\nJaundice can be a feature of obstruction of the biliary tract and can be seen in\ncholecystitis however, it is often mild or not seen unless there is presence of gallstones\nin the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis). In this stem, jaundice is absent.\nThe examination here shows a positive Murphy’s sign. Remember, Murphy sign is not\njust pain, but it is the arrest of inspiration when pressing the right costal margin at the\nmidclavicular line. It is a sign of acute cholecystitis. It is sensitive, but not specific to\ncholecystitis.\nThere is an elevation of ALP in this stem which ALP rises much higher than ALT which\npoints towards a form of biliary obstruction with cholestasis.\nThe likely scenario here is that there are gallstones that are obstructing the cystic duct\ncausing acute cholecystitis. Remember, more than 90% of the time, acute cholecystitis\noccurs from blockage of the cystic duct by a gallstone. When this occurs, the patient\nwould experience biliary colic.\nChronic cholecystitis is incorrect here as chronic cholecystitis occurs when there are\nrepeated episodes of infection causing thickening and fibrosis of gallbladder.\nAcute pancreatitis is incorrect as the amylase is within normal limits in this stem.\nAcute Cholecystitis\nAcute cholecystitis follows stone or sludge impaction in the neck of the\ngallbladder,which may cause continuous epigastric or RUQ pain (referred to the right\nshoulder),vomiting, fever, local peritonism, or a gallbladder mass.\nThe main difference from biliary colic is the inflammatory component (local\nperitonism,fever, and elevated WCC).\nIf the stone moves to the common bile duct (CBD), obstructive jaundice and\ncholangitismay occur\nMurphy’s sign is positive when you lay 2 fingers over the RUQ and ask patient\ntobreathe in which causes pain & arrest of inspiration as an inflamed gallbladder\nimpingeson your fingers. It is only positive if the same test in the LUQ does not cause\npain.\nTests:\nWCC would be elevated\nUltrasound shows a thick-walled, shrunken gallbladder\nManagement:\nNil by mouth, pain relief, IV fluids, and antibiotics.\nOnce symptoms settle, do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nLaparoscopiccholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for all patients fit for general\nanaesthesia.Open surgery is required if there is gall bladder perforation.",

The symptoms may begin after returning from travel, and may\nbeassociated with weight loss. Giardiasis can cause both acute and chronic diarrhoea.\nInthis stem, it is likely chronic diarrhoea as there is a history of weight loss.\nThe clinical features of giardiasis are slightly different compared to\ncampylobacterenteritis.

  "choice_e": "Request an endoscopy",
  "answer": "Request an endoscopy",
  "explanation": "This patient is less than 55 years old and does not have any red flags. As his initial\nantibodies for Helicobacter pylori are negative and his symptoms have not resolved, it\nwould be appropriate to refer this patient for an endoscopy. On the other hand, if his\nserum antibodies for Helicobacter pylori were initially positive, then a urea breath test\nwould be appropriate.\nGENERAL MANAGEMENT FOR DYSPEPSIA, HELICOBACTER PYLORI TESTING\nWhilst we have put in this diagram to use H. pylori antibody testinhg if no response to\nlifestyle modifications and antacids, NICE recommends any locally validated test for H.\npylori which include the carbon-13 urea breath test, stool antigen test, or serum\nantibody testing.\nIn practice, if the patient is taking proton pump inhibitors, remember to stop it 2 weeks\nprior to performing urea breath test or stool antigen test.\nThe only one test that you need to remember for re-testing for H. pylori is carbon-13\nurea breath test as NICe recommends this as there is still insufficient evidence to\nrecommend stool antigen test as a test for eradication. Serological tests have no value\nin confirming successful eradication because the antibodies persist after successful\neradication.",

The pain isseen worse at the\nepigastric area and radiates to the interscapular region of the back. His abdomen\nis soft and nontender. His respiratory rate is 29 breaths/minute, pulse rate is 110\nbeats/minute, a temperature of 37.8 C and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. A\nchest X-ray reveals mediastinal widening.

  "choice_c": "Pneumothorax",
  "choice_d": "Posterior mediastinitis",
  "choice_e": "Traumatic aortic injury",
  "answer": "Mediastinitis",
  "explanation": "Mediastinitismay occur after oesophageal perforation or rupture, due to a variety of\nreasons with endoscopy being one of them. Oesophageal perforation or rupture should\nnot be taken lightly as it is a life-threatening condition. Often air alongthe subcutaneous\nplanes or into the mediastinum would cause chest pain, dyspnoea, and fever. This\npatient should be considered critically ill and require management in the intensive care\nunit. It may be difficult to catch the diagnosis early in the course of mediastinitis as the\nsigns and symptoms may be subtle. However, as the condition progresses, patients\nwould experience increasing chest pain, respiratory distress, and odynophagia.\nThe most prominent symptom of mediastinitis is the chest pain and this localised\ndepending on the portion of mediastinum involved. In anterior mediastinitis, pain is\nlocated at the substernal region while in posterio mediastinitis, the pain is localised to\nthe epigastric region with radiation to the interscapular region.\nA chest X-raymay show widened mediastinum or air in the mediastinum. Water-soluble\ncontrast can be added if needed. IF there is diagnostic uncertainity, a direct\nvisualisation using endoscopy is used to confirm the diagnosis.\nThe principles of managing mediastinitis due to oesophageal perforation include\nrepairing the defect and treatment with antibiotics.",

  "explanation": "Chronic pancreatitis often presents with abdominal pain. Classically, the pain is located\nat the epigastrium and radiates to the back. The pain is worse after eating leading to a\ndislike of eating with consequent weight loss. The second most predominant feature is\nmalabsorption which is represented here by steatorrhoea. Malabsorption again\ncontributes to weight loss.\nAlcohol is one of the significant risk factors for chronic pancreatitis but it is not a good\nhint to pick crhonic pancreatitis as the answer based on an alcohol history as alcohol\nalso contributes to acute pancreatitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, oesophagitis and\nindirectly to pancreatic cancer.\nOne might consider “Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas” as the answer given the\nsimilar symptoms of weight loss, epigastric pain and history of alcohol. In reality, it is\ndifficult to differentiate the two hence the importance of imaging modalities such as\nultrasounds and CT scans.\nIn chronic pancreatitis, plain abdominal films of pancreas can show diffuse calcifications\nwhich indicate significant damage to the pancreas. X-rays of the abdomen aer not one\nof the main imaging modalities of the pancreas, and it is usually done for other reasons\nsuch as to exclude bowel perforation in A&E.

  "explanation": "The gastrin levels need to be checked to rule out a gastrinoma\nA gastrinoma is a neuroendocrine tumor usually found in the pancreas or duodenum.\nThese tumours secrete gastrin which stimulates parietal cells of the stomach to secrete\nhydrochloric acid into the stomach cavity leading to intractable peptic ulcerations.\nGastrinomas are suspected when peptic ulcers occur at unusual sites, such as the\nsecond part of the duodenum or the jejunum, or ulcers recur after adequate surgery.\nOne-third of patients have watery diarrhoea due to high gastric output. Diagnosis is\nmade by measurement of fasting gastrin levels or secretin stimulation test.\nZOLLINGER-ELLISON SYNDROME\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome is characterised by gastric acid over secretion due to\nexcessive levels of gasgtrin secreted from tumours found in the duodenum or pancreas.\nIt presents as severe peptic ulcer disease, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and diarrhoea.\nWhen to suspect Zollinger-Ellison syndrome?\nSuspect in those with:\n• Mulitiple peptic ulcers resistant to drugs\n• If associated with diarrhoea or steatorrhoea\n• Associated with family history of peptic ulcers",

For advanced cases of oesophageal cancer that\nare causing dysphagia, insertion of a stent into the oesophagus may be recommended.\nThe stent expands once in place and holds the oesophagus open to manage symptoms\nof dysphagia.\nAlthough radiotherapy also provides symptom relief (long-term relief), the waiting times\nfor initiation of radiotherapy is long, and there are long lag times between initiation of\ntreatment and relief of symptoms. Endoluminal stents provides more rapid and effective\nearly relief for symptomatic patients.\nPercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an endoscopic medical procedur in\nwhich a tube is passed into a patient’s stomach through the abdominal wall to provide a\nmeans of feeding when oral intake is not adequate. This is usually in stroke patients\nwho are at the risk of aspiration pneumonia or to decompress the stomach in cases of\ngastric volvulus.\nOESOPHAGEAL STENT\nAn oesophageal stent is a tube placed in the oesophagus to keep a blocked area open\nso that the patient can swallow soft food and liquids.

This is blatantly incorrect answer in the choices.\nSo we are left with two choices: senna and lactulose\nAccording to NICE CKS, we should try interventions for constipation in this order.\n1. High fibre diet\n2. Stimulatant laxative (senna)\n3. Osmotic laxative (laculose/macrogol)\n4. Add on a prokinetic agent such as metoclopramide, domperidone, or erythromycin\n5.

  "question": "A 35 year old man presented to his GP with the complaint of heartburn. This first\noccurred four weeks ago when he noticed epigastric pain with acid-reflux causing\na sore throat in his mouth following a meal. At the time of presentation, he\nclaimed that the only discomfort that he experienced was tenderness and pain in\nhis epigastric region. He complained of no altered bowel habits, sweating,\ndysphagia or generalised weakness. There was no history of non-steroidal anti-\ninflammatory drug (NSAID) use or recent infections. A neighbour advised him to\ntry a popular heartburn remedy so he went to his local pharmacy andtried an\nover-the-counter medication (Gaviscon ®). This only improved his symptoms\nminimally. The patient’s past medical history is significant for hypertension,\ndiagnosed two years ago which is now well controlled with medication. He used\nto drink around two to four cups of coffee per day which he claims he has now\nreduced to one cup per day. He has no history of smoking and only drinks\nsocially. Following his consultation, the patient was subsequently further\ninvestigated for a Helicobacter pylori infection, and the test returned with a\npositive result. He was started on triple therapy to eradicate his Helicobacter\npylori infection and his treatment regimen was successfully completed. He has\nnow returend for a review and states that he is still suffering from heartburn and\nindigestion. What is the SINGLE most appropriate test to ensure the eradication\nof Helicobacter pylori?",

  "explanation": "It is only necessary to check for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in patients whose\nsymptoms return. In this case, the patient was tested positive for Helicobacter pylori\nand started on triple therapy. His history shows that his compliance was good and that\nhe successfully finished his treatment. However, he still complains of indigestion. So the\nissue in this question is to choose the single best test that will confirm the eradication of\nHelicobacter pylori.\nWe know that the answer is a urea breath test as that is the only test that NICE\nrecommends post eradication, but is the answer a C13 urea breath test or a C14 urea\nbreath test?\nAccording to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the urea\nbreath test is the only current valid method for detecting eradication of Helicobacter\npylori infection. Urea can be labelled with two different carbon isotopes: C14 and C13.\nThe main difference between them is that the former is radioactive, whereas the latter is\nstable. The C13 urea breath test is the recommended test to perform. This is because\nit is a non-radioactive isotope which can be used safely for repeated testing, which is\nfrequently required in clinical practice.\nEndoscopy is only required if H. pylori is completely eradicated, as shown by urea\nbreath testing, to further investigate the cause of dyspepsia.",

  "explanation": "The likely diagnosis is acute pancreatitis given the elevated amylase.\nThe initial treatment for acute pancreatitis is supportive and includes earely fluid\nresuscitation, analgesia, and nutritional support.\nParenteral nutrition is only used when the enteral route is not tolerated, or if it is not\nmeeting specific caloric requirements.\nSurgical debridement may be required where there is proven infection and necrosis.\nNote that laparoscopic surgical debridement has largely been replaced by newer\nminimally invasive techniques such as transgastric endoscopy and video-assisted\ntranslumbare retroperitoneal necrosectomy followd by closed lavage of infected\npancreatic necrosis and so urgent laparoscopy is not the answer here. Also remember\nthat there need to be some evidence of necrosis before surgical debridement is\nconsidered.\nIntravenous antibiotics (e.g. IV imipenem) can be started in moderate to severe cases\neven without evidence of infected necrosis. This should preferably follow percutaneous\naspiration of peritoneal fluid for culture however in this case, fluid resuscitation,\nanalgesia and nutritional support are more important than just antibiotics.\n60% of acute pancreatitis in adults in the UK are due to gallstones and thus\ncholecystectomy can be considered but should only be considered after the initial\nsymptoms of acute pancreatitis have resolved.",

Abdominal sepsis is one of three\nmost common types of sepsis, particularly as this lady recently had a procedure at the\ntime of presentation is most suspicious of an infective pathology.\nOption A. Acute pancreatitis is incorrect as this typically / classically presentswith\nprofuse vomiting and central (umbilical) abdominal pain that radiates under the ribs.\nThis distribution of pain relates to the embryonic origins of the pancreas which is the\nmidgut.\nOption C. Acute cholecystitis is incorrect as although it is a good differential given the\npresentation, it is not the single best answer given the history of jaundice. Jaundice is\nnot typically present in cholecystitis.\nOption D. Cancer of the head of the pancreas is incorrect as there is nothing in the\nquestion to suggest a malignant pathology such as weight loss. Furthermore, the classic\npresentation of cancer of the head of the pancreas is ‘painless jaundice’.\nOption E. Upper GI perforation is incorrect as this usualoly presents with generalised\nabdominal tenderness with guarding and the patient will typically be much more unwell.\nThis is a good differential to keep in mind as the patient did just have recent endoscopy.\nHowever, if a perforationh had occurred, the patient would have become unwell\nimmediately at the time of the even, not twenty-four hours later!",

She has been on analgesics for 3 weeks for her back pain.\nShe is in obviousdiscomfort. Rectal examination reveals faecal impaction with\nhard stools. What is theSINGLE most appropriate immediate management?",
  "choice_a": "Codeine phosphate for pain relief",
  "choice_b": "High fiber diet",
  "choice_c": "IV fluids",
  "choice_d": "Phosphate enemas",
  "choice_e": "Urinary catheterisation",
  "answer": "Phosphate enemas",
  "explanation": "This is an example of overflolw diarrhoea. Medications such as opioid pain relievers\nreduce intestinal movement and may causefaecal matter to become too large, hard and\ndry making it difficult to expel. Subsequently, faeces become so harde that they cannot\nbe expelled and faecal fluid will flow around the block.\nPhosphate enemas contain acid phosphate and sodium phosphate. The osmotic\nactivity of the former increases the water contact of the stool so that rectal distension\nfollows and it is thought that this induces defecation by stimulating rectal motility. It has\na very quick onset of action which makes enemas useful for when a rapid evacuation of\na stony dull faecal impaction is required.\nPhosphate enema is the clear asnwer here as the question is addressing the immediate\nmanagement.\nIt is important to remember the relation between elderly, bedridden individuals and\nfaecal impaction. Fecal impaction isa fairly common complication of long-term\nconstipation in the elderly and bedridden, occurring in about 30% of all nursing home\nresidents. Hence in the exam, it is likely they would have the words, “Nursing home” in\nthe stem.\nFaecal impaction\nIf the patient has faecal impaction, try:\n• Bisacodyl suppositories\n• Arachis oil retention enema to soften\n• Phosphate enema\n• An alternative is polyethylene glycol, Movicol taken for three days\n• Manual removal (with midazolam, morphine, or caudal anaesthesia)\n• Once successful it is imperative to start regular oral measures to preventrecurrence of\nthe problem\nTo be more specific in managing faecal impaction:\nThese are quite specific and are unlikely to be asked in the PLAB exam but nonetheless\ngood for your practice.\n• For hard stools, consider using a high dose of an oral macrogol\n• For soft stools, or for hard stools after a few days treatment with a macrogol,consider\nstarting or adding an oral stimulant laxative.\n• If the response to oral laxatives is insufficient or not fast enough, consider:\n• Using a suppository: bisacodyl for soft stools; glycerol alone, or glycerolplus bisacodyl\nfor hard stools.\n• Using a mini enema\nThe final choice of laxative will depend on individual preference and what has\npreviously been tried.",

It was also established that the mass is a palpable non-tender mobile\nfluid filled lump that moves upwards on swallowing and on protrusion of the\ntongue. It was measured to be about 1.5 cm in diameter. After a thorough history\nand physical examination had been performed, the patient was suspected to have\na thyroglossal cyst.

  "choice_a": "",
  "choice_b": "",
  "choice_c": "",
  "choice_d": "",
  "choice_e": "",
  "answer": "Ultrasound of the neck",
  "explanation": "A thyroglossal cyst is a fibroid cyst that forms from a persistent thyroglossal duct. It\nusually presents as an asymptomatic fluid-filled midline neck mass below the level of\nthe hyoid bone. It is benign and results from an incomplete closure of the thyroid’s\nmigration path during fetal development.\nIt typically presents as a painless anterior midline neck mass and is found most often in\nchildhood or adolescence. This is a very important point to remember. Thyroglossal\ncyst accounts for around 75% of midline masses in children.\nThyroglossal cysts are congenital, however, the diagnosis can be made at any age with\nmost of them diagnosed before 10 years of age.\nHow do you diagnose a thyroglossal cyst?\nUltrasound of the cyst is a sensible next step and is performed to distinguish a solid cyst\nfrom fluid-filled components and to visualize the degree of the mass as well as its\nsurrounding tissues. It is the first line imaging study and ultrasound alone can be\nsufficient to conform the diagnosis in majority of cases.\nMRI or CT are used when malignancy is suspected but are not used routinely unless\nthere is a large cyst.\nThyroid scan with technitium 99m(Tc-99m) can be used to determine if there are any\nectopic thyroid tissue. Remember, the wall of a thyroglossal duct cyst is the second\nmost common site for ectopic thyroid tissue.\nFine needle aspiration cytology is performed in order to establish the character of the\ncells inside the cyst. However, given the low incidence of carcinoma in thyroid cyst\nespecially in children, preoperative biopsy of thyroglossal cyst is not cost effective and\nis not recommended.\nDiagnostic steps always move from least invasive to most invasive. In majority of\nquestions, the most appropriate investigation would be the gold standard diagnostic\nstep which normally involves a biopsy. This is not the case for thyroglossal cyst.\nUltrasound still remains the most appropriate investigation here.",

Her medical notes show that the last\nultrasound that she had shows an increased common bile duct diameter. What is\nthe SINGLE best investigation to perform now for this patient?",
  "choice_a": "ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography)",

  "choice_c": "Repeat ultrasound",
  "choice_d": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy",
  "choice_e": "Dissolution of gallstones",
  "answer": "Repeat ultrasound",
  "explanation": "The fact that this patient already has confirmed gallstones seen on ultrasound with an\nincreased common bile duct diameter means that it is highly likely that she is having a\nrepeat episode of biliary colic or perhaps even cholangitis. The next best investigation\nwould be to confirm the diagnosis on a repeat ultrasound.\nERCP is used primarily to diagnose and treat conditions of the bile ducts and main\npancreatic duct. Newer modalities such as MRCP produce detailed images of the\nhepatobiliary and pancreatic systems. This means that ERCP is now rarely performed\nwithout therapeutic intent.\nBILIARY COLIC\nOccurs when a stone temporarily occludes the cystic duct. There is a colicky pain in\ntheright upper quadrant radiating to right shoulder. The pain can also radiate to the back\nin the interscapular region. Nausea and vomiting are common which often\naccompanies the pain. The episode is usually self limiting.Ultrasound establishes\ndiagnosis of gallstones.\nContrary to its name “Biliary colic”, the pain usually does not fluctuate but instead is\nconsistent and can last anywhere between 15 minutes up to 24 hours where the pain\ngradually subsides spontaneously or with the help of analgesia.\nThe main difference of biliary colic and acute cholecystitis is the\ninflammatorycomponent. In acute cholecystitis there is local peritonism, fever, and\nelevated WCC.\nManagement includes:\n• Analgesia (usually opioids such as morphine)\n• Rehydrate\n• Nil by mouth.\n• Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is usually indicated",

Superior laryngeal nerve damage\nA unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve damage damage results in hoarseness and for\nbilateral damage symptoms include aphonia and airway obstruction.\nThe external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is one of the nerves\ncommonlyinjured in thyroid surgery. Injury to this nerve results in the inability to\nlengthen a vocalfold and, thus, inability to create a high-pitched sound (dysphonia).\nThey would have amono toned voice. This would be detrimental to a person who is a a\nprofessional singer.So in this stem, injury to the external branch of superior laryngeal\nnerve is likely toproduce symptoms of dysphonia.\nTHYROIDECTOMY COMPLICATIONS\nHypocalcaemia\n• Surgery can lead to trauma to the parathyroids, devascularization of the glands with\nresultant ischaemia, or removal of the glands during surgery. These would lead to\ndecreased production of parathyroid hormones (hypoparathyrodism) which\nultimately leads to decreased serum calcium\n• Acute hypocalcaemia generally presents at 24-48 hours\n• Postoperative hypoparathyrodism, and the resulting hypocalcaemia, may be\npermanent or transient.\n• The first symptms are usually tingling in the lips and fingertips. Additional findings\nmay develop, including carpopedal spasm, tetany, laryngospasm, seizures, QT\nprolongation and cardiac arrest. Chvostek’s sign is facial contractions elicited by\ntapping the facial nerve in the pre-auricular area. Trousseau’s sign is carpal spasm\non inflation of a blood pressure cuff.\nAirway obstruction (compressing haematoma, tracheomalacia)\n• Acute airway obstruction from haematoma may occur immediately postoperatively\nand is the most frequent cause of airway obstruction in the first 24 hours\n• Definitive therapy is opening the surgical incision to evacuate the haematoma\n• Re-intubation may be lifesaving for persistent airway obstruction.\nSuperior laryngeal nerve damage\n• The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is one of the nerves commonly\ninjured in thyroid surgery\n• Injury to this nerve results in the inability to lengthen a vocal fold and, thus, inability\nto create a high-pitched sound (dysphonia).

It can last for a few hours to a few days and may occasionally last much\nlonger. It is more common after bowel surgery due to the manual handling of the bowel\nloops. This patient has a distended abdomen, produced mainly from swallowed air that\ncannot pass through the bowel. This impairs the blood supply of the bowel wall and\nallows the absorption of toxins to occur.\nThe fact that this ptient has no bowel sounds upon auscultation helps differentiate\nparalytic ileus from mechanical obstruction. A silent abdomen is more diagnostic of\nparalytic ileus, whereas noisy bowel sounds indicate a mechanical obstruction. Another\ndifferentiating point is the absence of pain in this patient. Paralytic ileus tends to have\nless abdominal pain compared to mechanical obstruction.\nThe best way to treat this patient is to pass a nasogastric tube to remove the swallowed\nair and prevent gaseous distension. Furthermore, intravenus fluid and electrolyte\ntherapy should be administered with careful biochemical control.\nAn immediate laparotomy is not required as it is not an emergency and the patient is\nquite stable.",

These\ncan grow inside the ducts of the breast, often near to the nipple. They can bleed\ncausing a bloody discharge from the nipple. The masses are often too small to be\npalpated. They do not show up on a mammogram due to their small size. A\ngalactogram is therefore necessary to rule out the lesion.\nThe other optins are less likely to be the answer.\nDuct Ectasia – is suggested by a green or brown nipple discharge\nPaget’s disease of nipple – is suggested by breast nipple ‘eczema’\nNipple abscess – is suggested with a painful collection of pus forming in the breast\ntissue or around the nipple, usually as a result of bacterial infection\nFat necrosis is suggested by a firm and solitary localized lump usually with a history of\ntrauma",

  "question": "A 49 year old man had a sigmoid colectomy 48 hours ago. He is recovering well\nand has been apyrexial since the operation. His blood results postoperatively\nshow a CRP of 75 and a white blood cell count of 13 x 109/L. He is mobilising well\nand has started oral fluids and a light diet.

  "choice_d": "Repeat whole blood cell and CRP in 24 hours",
  "choice_e": "Reassure, no action required",
  "answer": "Repeat white blood cell and CRP in 24 hours",
  "explanation": "Mild abdominal discomfort is completely reasonable for someone who just had an\nabdominal surgery. A raised white cell count and CRP is not uncommon for a post-op\npatient and therefore antibiotics should not be initiated based on just these findings.\nSingle dose antibiotics are typically given on induction and it is not unless the patient is\nunwell or is pyrexic that it would be approprite to start intravenous antibiotics. This is\nbecause anastomotic leaks and wound infections are the feared complications of\nsigmoid colectomy.\nIn this case, he is completely asymptomatic so the best answer would be to repeat the\nwhite blood cell count and CRP in 24 hours. If these levels are seen decreasing the\nfollowing day, it is a reassuring sign and no action would be required.",

  "choice_c": "Reactionary haemorrhage",
  "choice_d": "Secondary haemorrhage",
  "choice_e": "Subphrenic abscess",
  "answer": "Acute gastric dilation",
  "explanation": "Patients can develop acute gastric dilatation as a postoperative complication\nofsplenectomy and abdominal surgery. This is due to disruption of blood supply to\nthestomach which predisposes to acute gastric dilatation. One of the causes of acute\ngastricdilatation is If the patient drinks too soon after an abdominal surgery when the\nstomachis still in ileus. The accumulation of fluid in the stomach may induce\nhypovolaemic shock.In addition, patients with acute gastric dilatation may proceed to\nhave a gastric rupture.This will lead to the development of peritonitis.\nSigns and symptoms of acute gastric dilatation include a distended and tender\nabdomen,epigastric fullness, nausea, vomiting and heartburn.\nInsertion of a nasogastric tube would allow decompression of the stomach\nandimmediately improve patients condition.\nGiven that the nasogastric tube relieved his symptoms, it is unlike that this is a bleed.\nThe other options are less likely\nPrimary haemorrhage → Occurs immediately after surgery or as a continuation of\nanintraoperative bleeding. This is usually due to an unsecured blood vessel.\nReactionary haemorrhage → Occurs within the first 24 hours and it is usually due\ntovenous bleeding and is commonly thought to be due to improved post-\noperativecirculation and fluid volume, which results in rolling or slipping of ligature. It is\nimportantto remember that postoperatively, the blood pressure would rise due to refilling\nof thevenous system and thus exposing unsecured vessels that bleed.\nSecondary haemorrhage → Develops 24 hours or more after the surgery. It occurs up\nto10 days post-operatively. It is usually due to infection of an operative wound or\nrawsurfaces causing clot disintegration and bleeding from exposed tissue.",

  "answer": "Ductal fistula",
  "explanation": "Ductal fistula (Mammillary fistula) is an abnormal communication between a\nmammary duct and the skin surface, usually near the areola and is suggested by\ndischarge from para-areolar region. A fistula may form following an incision and\ndrainage of an abscess hence the reason that a subareolar abscess is included in the\nhistory in this stem. Occasionally, there may be a history of a spontaneous rupture of\nan inflammatory mass preceding the development of the mammillary fistula. It is\nmanaged by excising and providing antibiotic cover. Recurrence of the ductal fistula is\ncommon.\nMammary duct ectasia is also another consideration as an answer. Duct ectasia\nrefers to dilatation of the large and intermediate breast ducts and it is suggested by a\ngreen or brown nipple discharge. The ducts become blocked and secretions stagnate.\nOccasionally, nipple retraction and a lump with local pain is seen. Duct ectasia also\noccurs in patients with recurrent breast abscesses. The infection is usually mixed\nanaerobic based.\nBreast abscess would usually present with unilateral localized pain, tenderness,\nerythema, purulent nipple discharge and a subareolar mass.

  "question": "A 40 year old manual worker presents with a swelling in the groin. He says he\nnoticed the appearance earlier today and it is accompanied by pain. On\nexamintion, a mass is found to be just above and lateral to the pubic tubercle. On\nexamination, the mass is reducible and impulse on coughing is seen. What is the\nSINGLE most likely diagnosis?",
  "choice_a": "Inguinal hernia",
  "choice_b": "Femoral artery aneurysm",
  "choice_c": "Femoral hernia",
  "choice_d": "Incarcerated hernia",
  "choice_e": "Strangulated hernia",
  "answer": "Inguinal hernia",
  "explanation": "The first hint here is his sex (male) and his occupation (manual worker). In adults,\nmalesex and heavy lifting are risk factors for inguinal hernias\nTraditionally it is taught that an inguinal hernia will lie above and medially to the\npubictubercle whereas a femoral hernia lies laterally and below. This is not strictly true,\nas theinternal ring is always lateral to the femoral canal and a small indirect inguinal\nhernia willtherefore be lateral to the pubic tubercle. A better test to differentiate the two\nmight beto place the finger over the femoral canal for reducible hernias and then ask the\npatientto cough. When the patient coughs, a femoral hernia should remain reduced\nwhile aninguinal hernia will reappear as an obvious swelling.\nRemember, inguinal hernias has impulse on coughing or bearing down. Femoral\nherniasare usually irreducible (due to the narrow femoral canal) and cough impulse\nrarelydetectable.\nIncarcerated hernia cannot be pushed back into the abdomen by applying\nmanualpressure and hence are irreducible.\nStrangulated hernia are also irreducible. They are tense and red and usually followed\nbysymptoms and signs of bowel obstruction.\nDiscrimination between direct and indirect inguinal hernia by physical examination is\nnotvery accurate. In an indirect inguinal hernia, the protrusion passes through the\ndeepinguinal ring and is located lateral to the inferior epigastric artery. Whilst\ntraditionaltextbooks describe the anatomical differences between indirect (hernia\nthrough theinguinal canal) and direct hernias (through the posterior wall of the inguinal\ncanal), thisis of no clinical relevance as the management still remains the same. The\ntype ofinguinalhernia in adults is usually confirmed at the operation.",

  "question": "A 64 year old man has just had major abdominal surgery. He is not a known\nsmoker and takes no chronic medications. His post-operative pain is being\neffectively controlled with epidural analgesia. Ten hours post-operatively, he was\nnoticed to have only passed 30 ml of urine in his catheter bag. The patient is\notherwise alert, oriented and well. His blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg and his\npulse rate is 90 beats/minute. What is the SINGLE most appropriate initial step\nfor this patient?",
  "choice_a": "Stop epidural analgesia",
  "choice_b": "Check urinary catheter",
  "choice_c": "Administer intravenous fluids",
  "choice_d": "Ultrasound of bladder",
  "choice_e": "Alpha blocker treatment",
  "answer": "Check urinary catheter",
  "explanation": "The fact that he still has a catheter, the initial step would be to check the catheter.\nSometimes the catheter or drainage bag tubing may be kinked and you just need to\nstraighten it. It could also be that the catheter is blocked in which case a simple flush\nmay fix it. The position of the catheter and drainage back is also important whereby it\nshould be positioned below your bladder for urine to drain.\nPost-operative urinary retention cannot happen when he has a urinary catheter in situ.\nThus, there would be less of a reason to perform an ultrasound of the bladder at this\nstage. In whichever case, stopping analgesia would be the wrong answer as this\npatient has just undergone a major abdominal surgery and requires analgesia for\nadequate management of his pain.\nAdministration of fluids may be considered if we are considering an intraabdominal\nbleed as a cause of an acute kidney injury resulting in decreased urine output. This is\nnot the case here as this patient is normotensive.\nIf the patient had postoperative hypotension and consequently developed oliguria, it\nwould be reasonable to correct this by means of a fluid challenge. Patients can develop\npostoperative hypotension and decreased urine output due to several reasons, one of\nwhich is haemorrhage.\nIn addition to this, oliguria may be caused by the adrenal cortex and posterior pituitary\nresponse tostress which release aldosterone and ADH respectively. Mainly this can\nhappen during the first 24 hours after an operation is essential to know that oliguria\nshould be temporary and not last more than 24 hours. If a urine output is less than 400\nml in the first 24 hours, further investigations are warranted.\nWhat does fluid challenge mean?\nThis involves the following steps:\n• Rapid (up to 15 minute) administration of 500 ml crystalloid (normal\nsaline/Hartmann’s)\n• Immediate reassessment – if there is still evidence of hypovolaemia administer a\nfurther bolus of a crystalloid\nIn practice, doctors often prescribe 1 L of a crystalloid stat.\nWhy choose a crystalloid over a colloid for resuscitation?\nTheoretically, colloids exert more osmotic load and is able to keep more fluids\nintravascularly however there is evidence of increased rates of renal failure associated\nwith colloid resuscitation and one has to take into account that colloids are a lot more\nexpensive than crystalloids. For those reasons, clinicians prefer the use of crystalloids\nas a choice of fluid for resuscitation.",

  "question": "A 41 year old female presents to her GP concerned about the possibility of her\nhaving breast cancer. Her family history is significant for her grandmother\nhaving passed away from breast cancer, her mother having had a right\nmastectomy last year and her sister who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age\n38 who is currently in remission from breast cancer. Gene typing was done\nbased on her family history and the presence of the BRCA1 gene mutation were\nshown in this patient. Her last mammogram was 6 months ago and was found to\nbe normal. Examination of the breast revealed no skin changes, no nipple\nchanges and no masses. A 1 cm by 1 cm, smooth and non-tender lymph node\nwas found in her axilla. What is the SINGLE most appropriate next step for this\npatient?",
  "choice_a": "Mammogram",
  "choice_b": "Ultrasound of the breast",
  "choice_c": "Sentinel node biopsy",
  "choice_d": "Fine needle aspiration",
  "choice_e": "Offer prophylactic mastectomy",
  "answer": "Offer prophylactic mastectomy",
  "explanation": "A prophylactic mastectomy might seem drastic at this stage but with her family history\nand genetic mutations, she is at a very high risk of developing breast cancer. There are\nfour instances in which a prophylactic mastectomy of either one or both breasts should\nbe carried out. These are as follows:\n• Strong family history of breast cancer\n• Presence of inherited mutations in one of two breast cancer susceptibility genes\n(BRCA1 and BRCA2)\n• Previous cancer in one breast\n• Biopsies showing lobular carcinoma in situ and/or atypical hyperplasia of the breast.\nAs we can see from the scenario, this patient ticks two out of the four boxes. The next\nbest step for her would be a referral to a surgeon for a prophylactic mastectomy.\nWomen aged 50 to 70 years old in England are offered mammograms every 3 years. In\ncases like this patient where there is BRCA1 mutation, a mammogram would be offered\nannually from ages 40 to 69. Since she just had it 6 months ago, it is not the right\nanswer. The NHS takes breast cancer risk very seriously, and would take\nprecuationary steps such as organising MRI scans of the breast annually as well as\nmammograms for those who have a BRCA1 mutation.\nAn ultrasound of the breast is used in cases in which a breast lump is found during\nexamination of the breast.\nA sentinel node biopsy isdone for the staging of cancers. The sentinel lymph node is\nthe first lymph node or group of lymph nodes that drain a cancer site.\nFine needle aspiration is done if a lump was found during breast examination. It is done\nafter an ultrasound of the breast.\nRemember, prophylactic bilateral mastectomies and prophylactic bilateral\noophorectomies can be offered in cases in which the patient has a strong family history\nof cancer and has genetic markers for the cancer.",

Although in Ramsay Hunt Syndrome\nthepresenting feature is often pain deep within the ear, there is usually a rash or\nherpeticblisters in the distribution of the nervus intermedius.\nA dental abscess would present with worsening pain which may radiate to the\nipsilateralear, jaw and neck with a bad taste in the mouth, fever, malaise and trismus\n(inability toopen the mouth). The ulceration of the tongue does not fit in this case.\nTonsillitis pain may be referred to ears but on examination, reddened and swollentonsils\nwould definitely be seen.

  "choice_d": "Oxygen 15 L via non-rebreather mask",
  "choice_e": "Salbutamol Nebulizer",
  "answer": "Cut the subcutaneous sutures",
  "explanation": "This is a very common question in PLAB part 1. Once you do a few of these\nquestions,you would soon realise that you would be able to answer this question after\nreading thefirst sentence. Anyone with shortness of breath and stridor after a very\nrecentthyroidectomy needs their sutures cut.\nA rare complication of thyroidectomy is upper airway obstruction secondary\ntohaematoma. To prevent the airway from being totally occluded, it is necessary\ntoreleasethe pressure this haematoma is causing by loosening the tightness of the\ncompartmentin which it is building up. If this does not improve his breathing, this man\nwill very soonneed intubation. Whilst this is a rare scenario and not important per se , it\nis stillcommonly asked in exams.\nAdrenaline → is used in anaphylaxis, which is a reasonable differential in stridor (due\ntolaryngoedema), but is less likely here than the local effects of the surgery.\nLow molecular weight heparin → is the treatment for a pulmonary embolus, which\ndoescause sudden breathlessness, but not due to upper airway compromise.\nOxygen → is a reasonable response to dropping SaO2 in someone with healthy lungs\nbut is not the treatment that is going to arrest this man’s upper airway occlusion.\nSalbutamol Nebulizer → is useful to open smaller constricting airways (e.g. in asthma\norCOPD) but will not reduce the pressure effect of a haematoma on the trachea.",

Atelactasis presents with much of the same signs and\nsymptoms except it presents with hypoxia, and here we can see that the PaO2 is\ngreater than normal.\nThere was no mention of a fever so IV antibiotics is the incorrect answer as well.\nThe diagnosis here is hyperoxaemia or hyperoxia\nHyperoxaemia/Hyperoxia\nHyperoxaemia or hyperoxia is defined as PaO2 > 16 KpA (120 MMhG). This kind of\nhyperoxia can lead to oxygen toxicity, caused from the harmful effects of breathing\nmolecular oxygen at elevated partial pressures. Hyperoxia differs from hypoxia in that\nhyperoxia refers to a state in which oxygen supply is too much, whereas hypoxia refers\nto the state in which oxygen supply is insufficient.\nAtelectasis\nAtelectasis is also known as alveolar collapse.

  "choice_c": "Cholangiocarcinoma",
  "choice_d": "Choledocholithiasis",
  "choice_e": "Cholecystitis",
  "answer": "Cancer of the head of the pancreas",
  "explanation": "This patient has cancer of the head of the pancreas. The initial signs and symptoms of\npancreatic cancer are often non-specific and patients will report anything from anorexia\nto mid-epigastric/back pain. The pain for carcinoma of the head of pancreas is often\nvery vague and this stem portrays it well. By the time of patient presentation, pancreatic\ncancer will have often spread to other parts of the body or the entirety of the pancreas.\nThe clue that points to pancreatic cancer in this stem is the patient’s drastic weight loss\nAND the elevation of her bilirubin levels as well as all of her liver enzymes.\nLiver function tests are done in patients in whom pancreatic cancer is suspected to\nconfirm jaundice. Liver function tests will typically show an obstructive jaundice with\nraised bilirubin (conjugated and total) levels. There will also be an increase in all other\nlive enzymes with alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase being raised\nthe most, and aspartate transferase and alanine transferase being raised to a lesser\nextent. The reason for an obstructive picture is because the tumour of the head of the\npancreas blocks the biliary tract.\nThe palpable mass just beneath the liver described in this stem represents the\ngallbladder which is typically palpable in patients with carcinoma of the head of\npancreas.\nOther subtle hints that point towards pancreatic cancer is the more than average alcohol\nintake and smoking which are risk factors. It is important to note that alcohol does not\nappear to be an independent risk factor but alcohol is a risk factor towards chronic\npancreatitis which may lead to pancreatic cancer.\nCholangiocarcinoma are rare adenocarcinomas of the biliary tract often presents with\nabdominal pain mostly localised to the right upper quadrant. The triad of\ncholangiocarcinoma is jaundice, right upper quadrant pain and weight loss. Right upper\nquadrant pain is the main differentiating feature in this stem of cholangiocarcinoma from\npancreatic cancer since the liver function tests of cholangiocarcinoma may be similar to\nthe liver function test results of pancreatic cancer.\nPANCREATIC CANCER\n60% of pancreatic tumours are adenocarcinomas which typically occur at the head of\nthepancreas.\nAssociations\n- Smoking\n- Diabetes\n- Chronic pancreatitis\nFeatures\nTumours in the head of pancreas\n• Obstructive jaundice → dark urine, pale stools and pruritus\n• May be painless although around 70% are associated with epigastric or left upper\nquadrant pain radiating to the back which may be vague\nTumours in body or tail of pancreas\n• Epigastric pain which radiates to the back and relieved by sitting forward\nEither tumour in head or body/tail may cause:\n• Anorexia, weight loss\n• Atypical abdominal pain\nInvestigation\n• CA 19-9 is non specific but helps assess prognosis\n• Transabdominal ultrasound has a sensitivity of around 60-90%\n• High resolution CT scanning is the investigation of choice\nManagement\n• Whipple's resection (pancreaticoduodenectomy) is considered in fit patients with no\nmetastasis\n• ERCP with stenting is often used for palliation",

  "choice_c": "Pelvic haematoma",
  "choice_d": "Metastatic spread",
  "choice_e": "Intestinal obstruction",
  "answer": "Anastomotic leak",
  "explanation": "The scenario is quite straightforward and depicts one of the most common and feared\nsurgical complications after anterior resection of the bowel: an anastomotic leak.\nAn anastomotic leak is defined as a leak of the luminal contents from a surgical joint\nbetween two hollow viscera. There are several risk factors that increase the risk of an\nanastomotic leak developing, such as peritoneal contamination, rectal anastomosis,\nimmunocompromised, various medications and smoking. In this patient, there is a\nsignificant history of long term smoking. He is also a known case of chronic pulmonary\nobstructive disease (COPD). Prolonged use of steroids also increases the risk of\nanastomotic leak.\nThe patient has a fever and abdominal pain which are the most common clinical\nfeatures of an anastomotic leak. They usually present between five to ten days\npostoperatively. This can be quite dangerous especially if it leads to peritonitis. In this\nquestion, peritonitis has not developed yet as in peritonitis, the patient usually has\nsevere generalised abdominal pain with generalized guarding and rigidity.\nA pelvic haematoma is not the correct option. Pelvic haematomas are seen in obstetric\nor gynaecology surgeries where bleeding results in collection of blood in the pelvic\nperitoneal space.\nThe key principle in managing an anastomotic leak is to prevent contamination and\nresultant sepsis. Initial management involves nil by mouth (NBM), broad-spectrum\nantibiotic cover and intravenous fluids. Minor leaks may be managed through\nobservation and bowel rest alone, with potential for percutaneous drainage if needed.\nFor a major leak, an exploratory laparotomy is required.\nHot tip: In the exam, if a patient presents 10 days post bowel surgery with abdominal\npain, it is likely to be an anastomotic leak.",

  "choice_e": "Ovarian torsion",
  "answer": "Appendicitis",
  "explanation": "The pain that has shifted towards the right iliac fossa and the fact that there is a positive\nMcBurney’s sign and loose stools makes the diagnosis of appendicitis more likely. One\ncannot rule out ectopic pregnancy and so ideally an ultrasound scan would take place to\nconfirm that the pregnancy is in utero. However, the clinical features and the blood\nresults in the above stem clearly show evidence of an acute appendicitis.\nNote that appendicitis is usually more difficult to diagnose in pregnancy as the position\nof the appendix is usually higher as pregnancy progresses and the uterus enlarges. If a\nwoman is 28 weeks pregnant, she may feel the pain at the right central abdomen or\nright upper quadrant.\nIn reality, it would be difficult to differentiate an ectopic pregnancy from appendicitis and\nthe likely action in an unwell (but stable) patient is to perform a laparoscopy to identify\nthe cause of the severe abdominal pain. As this stem is pointing more towards the\ndiagnosis of appendicitis, it would be ideal if the general surgeon took this patient to\ntheatre and performed a laparoscopy whilst the gynaecology team is on standby to take\nover in the event the general surgeons find an ectopic pregnancy.",

The single best way to relieve her pain is to insert a nasogastric tube to\nempty the stomach of fluid and gas.\nThe distractor here is the palliative stoma. Advance ovarian cancers can metastasise to\nthe bowels and cause kinks in it leading to symptoms of bloating. If surgery was\nrequired, part of the bowel may be removed and a stoma may be created. However,\ngiven her symptoms coincide with immobilisation and are rather acute, inserting a\nnasogastric tube would be a better answer as it would relieve the pain almost\nimmediately.\nMorphine and all its analogues would worsen her symptoms. The matter of fact,\ntreatment of paralytic ileus involves reducing opiate analgesia.\nAlthough endoscopic stenting can be used for palliative care, it is long term treatment\nand, in this case, can be considered once the patient is stable.",

  "answer": "Arrange an urgent admission",
  "explanation": "This is a tricky question and has two parts. The first part is figuring out what the patient\nhas. This patient likely has diverticular disease however colorectal cancer needs to be\nalso considered. Some useful definitions for diverticular disease are as follows:\n• A diverticulum (plural diverticula) is a herniation of the large colon\n• Diverticulosis is the presence of asymptomatic diverticula\n• Diverticular disease refers to diverticula that are symptomatic\n• Diverticulitis is inflammation of diverticula and is almost always symptomatic\nDiverticular disease is common in those who have a low dietary fibre intake and in those\nover the age of 50. It frequently presents with lower abdominal pain which is usually\nleft-sided, bloating, constipation, rectal bleeding or features of inflammation (fever,\ntachycardia). NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries (CKS) states that all patients with\ndiverticular disease who are symptomatic and who are haemodynamically unstable\nrequire urgent admission. This patient would need to be admitted as an acute surgical\nemergency for a suspected haemorrhage from a diverticulum with possible diverticulitis.\nThis patient would benefit from intravenous antibiotics instead of oral antibiotics.\nIntravenous fluids to replace fluid is also essential but not mentioned in the options.\nDietary advice alone is reserved for patients who are symptomatic but who do not meet\nthe criteria for admission.\nAntispasmodics have no role in the acute management of diverticulitis. Furthermore,\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should generally be avoided as it may\nincrease the risk of diverticular perforation.\nThe patient would likey have a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to establish the\ndiagnosis and to determine the severity. An urgent colonoscopy to treat the source of\nbleeding if there is diverticular haemorrhage may also be warranted. A full blood count\nneeds to be taken to ensure the patient is not severely anaemic. If her haemoglobin\nhas dropped significantly, a blood transfusion would be arranged. A C-reactive protein\n(CRP) would also be important to include a CRP of 50 mg/L or more in this patient\nwould suggest an acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.\nThe critical point to remember for this question is that one of the complications of acute\ndiverticulitis is a MASSIVE PER RECTAL bleed which warrants admission.\nDIVERTICULITIS\nDiverticulitis is the inflammation of a diverticulum.\nClinical features of acute diverticulitis\n• Rapid onset left iliac fossa pain and tenderness\n• Nausea and vomiting\n• Diarrhoea\n• Features of infection such as fever, raised WBC and CRP\nInvestigations\nIf in the hospital, computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis is one\nthat is most used to establish the diagnosis, determine the severity, and exclude other\ndifferentials.\nTreatment\nAntibiotics\nIt is unlikely that the exam would ask you for the antibiotic choice, but for those who\nwould like to know more, keep on reading.\nIf the patient presents to primary care and if mild, uncomplicated diverticulitis is\nsuspected:\n• Co-amoxiclave for 7 days\n• Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole if the patient is penicillin allergic\nIf the patient has a more significant episode and needs to be managed in hospital\n• Intravenous antibiotics (cefuroxime + metronidazole is a good option)",

Why are the features of Fragile X-syndrome seen more in males\neven though females are more often affected (an X-linked dominant condition)?\nThis is because males display a complete penetrance and therefore almost always\ndisplay symptoms of Fragile X syndrome however females display penetrance of\nabout 50% as a result of having a second normal X-chromosome and so they have\nsymptoms that are less severe than males.\nX-linked recessive\nMale child has a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic condition if MOTHER is a carrier.\nFemale child has a 50% chance of becoming a carrier if MOTHER is a carrier.

  "choice_a": "Ensure donor is adequately hydrated and has not skipped a meal",
  "choice_b": "Elevating the donor’s legs as this is usually due to a vasovagal syncope",
  "choice_c": "Ensure haemoglobin of the donor meets the minimum requirements for",
  "choice_d": "The donation is continued along with simultaneous normal saline infusion",
  "choice_e": "The donor should be encouraged to mobilise after they have recovered",
  "answer": "The donation is continued along with simultaneous normal saline infusion",
  "explanation": "This question may seem tricky, but it is actually really simple. You need to read the\nquestion well; it states, ‘which would be the LEAST useful in managing the adverse\nevent’\nA is correct. Blood donors should ensure they are well hydrated and have eaten well\nbefore donating blood.\nB is correct. Elevation of the legs would cause more blood to return to the heart and\nhence more blood to be pumped to the brain.\nC is correct. People should not donate blood if their haemoglobin level is below the\nlower limit of normal.\nE is correct. The donor should be encouraged to eat, rest and continue their normal\nactivities as soon as possible after the donation.\nThis leaves us with D. If a donor faints whilst giving blood, YOU IMMEDIATELY STOP\nTHE DONATION. You should never continue bleeding the donor if an adverse event\nhas occurred or is about to occur.\nIn general, you should not take more than 30 seconds to answer these types of\nquestions.",

There areseveral well\nknown associations with the development of acute leukaemiathat are sometimes\npresent. These include radiation exposure,chemotherapeutic agents, as well as some\nretroviruses.\nClinical Presentation\nThe most common presentation results from the effects of the leukaemicblast cells\ncrowding out the normal marrow cells, resulting in symptoms ofpancytopenia even if the\ntotal white blood cell count is normal.\n• Fatigue from anaemia is the most common presenting complaint.\n• Bleeding, petechiae, purpura or ecchymoses (due tothrombocytopenia)\n• Recurrent and severe infections (oral, throat, skin, perianalinfections commonly). This\nis because of the underproduction orabnormal function of white blood cells.\n• Left upper quadrant fullness and early satiety due to splenomegaly(10-20%)\nAcute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) is more common in children, and\nacutemyelogenous leukaemia (AML) is more common in adults, but they\nareindistinguishable clinically. This means you cannot determine the diagnosisonly from\nthe clinical presentation.\nALL is more often associated with infiltration of other organs, but AML cando it as well.\nEnlargement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes and bonepain are common at\npresentation.\nDiagnosis\nThe FBC is the first clue to the diagnosis. Depression of all three cell lines is\ncommon at presentation.\nFBC\n• Anaemia is usual and Hb may be below 5 g/L\n• The white cell count can be low, normal, or elevated\n• Thrombocytopenia\nMany other disorders can present as pancytopenia similar to leukaemiasuch as aplastic\nanaemia, infections involving the marrow, metastaticcancer involving the marrow,\nvitamin B12 deficiency, SLE, hypersplenism,and myelofibrosis. However, none of these\nwill have leukaemic blastscirculating in the peripheral blood. Although pancytopenia can\ncause all ofthe above, in PLAB, when pancytopenia is in the options, it is\nusuallyleukaemia, or aplastic anaemia.\nA bone marrow biopsy showing numerous blasts confirms the diagnosis ofacute\nleukaemia.\nIt is very unlikely that the PLAB questions would ask you to differentiate theAML from\nALL using specific test. However, if a child (young age) is givenwith signs and\nsymptoms of pancytopenia, ALL would be the most likely asit is the commonest\nchildhood leukaemia.\nNote:\n• ALL is the commonest childhood leukaemia. Peak age is 2–4 yearsold.\n• The Philadelphia chromosome occurs in 15–30% (mostly adults) andis associated\nwith a poor prognosis.\nLEUKAEMIA COMPARISONS\nACUTE LEUKEMIAS\nAcute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML)\n• Fatigue from anaemia • Symptoms of anaemia\n• Bleeding caused by thrombocytopenia • Bleeding caused by thrombocytopenia\n• Recurrent and severe infections • Infection\n• Splenomegaly • Gingivitis is common, with swollen,\nbleeding gums\nAcute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) is\nmore common in children, and acute FBC: Auer rods\nmyelogenous leukaemia (AML) is more Total WBC count is often high.\ncommon in adults, but they are Neutrophils are usually depleted and blast\nindistinguishable clinically cells are seen in their place\nBone marrow aspiration is the diagnostic\nIn the exam, when pancytopenia is in the procedure\noptions, it is usually leukaemia, or aplastic\nanaemia.

  "explanation": "This patient has a haemolytic anaemia. A direct antiglobulin test is a synonym for a\ndirect Coombs test.\nThe direct Coombs test is used to test for autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or in other\nwords any condition of an anaemia caused by immune system lysis or destruction of red\nblood cells.\nSome examples of diseases that test positive for a direct Coombs test include\nalloimmune haemolysis (such as Rhesus disease), autoimmune haemoloysis (such as\nsystemic lupus erythematosus) or drug-induced immune-mediated haemolysis.\nThe term “polychramasia” used in this stem refers to a disorder where there is an\nabnormally high amount of immature red blood cells. A haemolytic anaemia such as\nthis case (or any other form of anaemia) would trigger erythropoeitin release and\nincrease the rate of which red blood cells are produced and released from the bone\nmarrow. When levels of erythropoeitin are high, immature red cells would be released\ninto the bloodstream.\nCOOMBS TEST\nThere are two Coombs tests:\n1. The direct Coombs test (DCT, also known as direct antiglobulin test or DAT)\n2. The indirect Coombs test (also known as indirect antiglobulin test or IAT)\nDirect Coombs test\n• Used to test for autoimmune haemolytic anaemia\n• It is used to detect these antibodies or complement proteins that are bound to the\nsurface of red blood cells.

His mother complains that he has been having recurrent sore\nthroats that come and go in last couple of months. Pale conjunctivae is noticed\non examination.

  "choice_b": "Microcytes",
  "choice_c": "Granulocyte without blast cells",
  "choice_d": "Blast cells",
  "choice_e": "Mature lymphocytes",
  "answer": "Blast cells",
  "explanation": "Before looking at the cell types, think of the diagnosis. The most likely diagnosis here is\nAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) as he is young, suffering recurrent infections (due\nto abnormal WBCs), and having pale conjunctiva (anaemia). The bleeding gums and\nnosebleeds tell you that he has thrombocytopaenia.\nAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) both have\nnumerous blast cells.\nAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)\nAetiology\nMost cases of acute leukaemia arise with no apparent cause. There are several well\nknown associations with the development of acute leukaemia that are sometimes\npresent. These include radiation exposure, chemotherapeutic agents, as well as some\nretroviruses.\nClinical Presentation\nThe most common presentation results from the effects of the leukaemic blast cells\ncrowding out the normal marrow cells, resulting in symptoms of pancytopenia even if\nthe total white blood cell count is normal.\n• Fatigue from anaemia is the most common presenting complaint.\n• Bleeding, petechiae, purpura or ecchymoses (due to thrombocytopenia)\n• Recurrent and severe infections (oral, throat, skin, perianal infections commonly). This\nis because of the underproduction or abnormal function of white blood cells.\n• Left upper quadrant fullness and early satiety due to splenomegaly (10-20%)\nAcute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) is more common in children, and acute\nmyelogenous leukaemia (AML) is more common in adults, but they are indistinguishable\nclinically. This means you cannot determine the diagnosis only from the clinical\npresentation.\nALL is more often associated with infiltration of other organs, but AML can do it as well.\nEnlargement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes and bone pain are common at\npresentation.\nDiagnosis\nThe FBC is the first clue to the diagnosis. Depression of all three cell lines is\ncommon at presentation.\nFBC\n• Anaemia is usual and Hb may be below 5 g/L\n• The white cell count can be low, normal, or elevated\n• Thrombocytopenia\nMany other disorders can present as pancytopenia similar to leukaemia such as aplastic\nanaemia, infections involving the marrow, metastatic cancer involving the marrow,\nvitamin B12 deficiency, SLE, hypersplenism, and myelofibrosis. However, none of these\nwill have leukaemic blasts circulating in the peripheral blood. Although pancytopenia\ncan cause all of the above, in PLAB, when pancytopenia is in the options, it is usually\nleukaemia, or aplastic anaemia.\nA bone marrow biopsy showing numerous blasts confirms the diagnosis of acute\nleukaemia.\nIt is very unlikely that the PLAB questions would ask you to differentiate the AML from\nALL using specific test. However, if a child (young age) is given with signs and\nsymptoms of pancytopenia, ALL would be the most likely as it is the commonest\nchildhood leukaemia.\nNote:\n• ALL is the commonest childhood leukaemia. Peak age is 2–4 years old.\n• The Philadelphia chromosome occurs in 15–30% (mostly adults) and is associated\nwith a poor prognosis.",

The bleeding may lead to nerve compression, or compartment syndrome\nInvestigations\n• Prothrombin time, bleeding time, fibrinogen levels and von Willebrand factor are\nnormal\n• Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is usually prolonged but can be normal in\nmild disease\n• Factor VIII/XI assay to diagnose\nRemember these test to distinguish haemophilia from Von Willebrand disease\n• Haemophilia\n• Only aPTT is prolonged\n• Has factor type bleeding (deep bleeding into muscles and joints)\n• Von willebrand disease\n• aPTT and bleeding time are prolonged\n• Has platelet type bleeding (mucosal bleeding)\nHaemophilia A-specific treatment\n• Desmopressin raises factor VIII levels, and may be sufficient to treat Haemophilia type\nA\n• Major bleeds (eg haemarthrosis): May need treatment with recombinant factor VIII\n• Do not give IM injections when factor is low\nHaemophilia B-specific treatment\n• Recombinant factor IX is the treatment of choice\n• Note: Desmopressin has no value in treatment of haemophilia B\nAvoid NSAIDS and IM injections!\nQuestions may arise with this topic. In PLAB, in whichever scenario, avoid NSAIDS and\nIM injection as the answer in Haemophilia. NSAIDs must not be employed for the fear of\ngastrointestinal haemorrhage. If needed, give opiates for pain relief and if given\nparenterally, pick intravenously (IV) or possibly subcutaneously (SC) but not\nintramuscularly (IM). IM injection will produce a large and painful haematoma.",

  "answer": "Hereditary spherocytosis",
  "explanation": "The evidence of increased MCHC, gallstones and family history points towards\nhereditary spherocytosis.\nHereditary Spherocytosis\nHereditary Spherocytosis is the most common inherited RBC membrane defect\ncharacterized by variable degrees of haemolysis, spherocytic RBCs with increased\nosmotic fragility.\nApproximately 75% of cases display an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance; the\nrest are recessive forms and de novo mutations.\nClinical features\n• Patients may present at any age with haemolytic anaemia, jaundice (either from\nhaemolysis or gallstones) and splenomegaly\n• 20-30% of patients have mild disease with an increased red cell turnover\ncompensated with adequate replacement. They are neither symptomatic nor anaemic,\nbut may have mild splenomegaly, slight reticulocytosis and minimal spherocytes\nvisible.\n• 60-70% of patients have moderate disease and half of these present in childhood with\nanaemia.\n• Neonates with severe hereditary disease do not always present at birth with anaemia,\nbut haemoglobin may fall dramatically over the first few weeks of life and may be\nsevere enough to require exchange transfusion.\n• Occasional aplastic crises occur, e.g. with parvovirus B19 infection.\nDiagnosis\n(These are the 3 most important test that you need to know in the exam for Hereditary\nSpherocytosis)\n• Blood film shows spherocytes and increased reticulocytes\n• MCHC would be elevated\n• Osmotic fragility test → confirms presence of spherocytes but does not permit\nhereditary spherocytosis to be distinguished from other spherocytic haemolytic\ndisorders such as autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. This is not reliable until six\nmonths of age.\nSome authors mention that osmotic fragility test is unreliable and is no longer\nrecommended. However, it is still considered the gold standard despite missing up to\n20% of cases. In the PLAB exam, osmotic fragility test may be given as a choice for a\ndiagnostic test for Hereditary Spherocytosis. Pick it if it is.\nNote:\nSpherocytosis almost always refers to hereditary spherocytosis but note that\nspherocytes are found in hereditary spherocytosis and also autoimmune haemolytic\nanaemias. The test to distinguish the two would be a direct Coombs test. Hereditary\nspherocytosis has a negative direct Coombs test but autoimmune haemolytic anaemias\nhave a positive direct Coombs test\nManagement\nSteroid therapy\n• effective in augmenting haemoglobin levels during haemolytic crises in patients with\nmoderate disease\nFolate supplementation\nSplenectomy\n• eliminates anaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia and lowers the high reticulocyte number\nto nearly normal levels\n• Splenectomy is curative in most patients but increased recognition of the long-term\nrisks of splenectomy has led to re-evaluation of the role of splenectomy.\nMild cases do not usually require folate supplements or splenectomy\nComplications\n• Rapid haemolysis can be triggered by viral infections and produce jaundice, anaemia\nand occasionally abdominal pain and tender splenomegaly. Supportive treatment is\nusually all that is needed.\n• Aplastic crises (aplastic anaemia). They are most commonly caused by infection with\nparvovirus B19 and usually last 10-14 days. This can be life-threatening.\nWhen you see parvovirus B19 in the exam, immediately think of sickle cell anaemia or\nhereditary spherocytosis\nParvovirus and anaemia\nAlthough most patients have a decrease of erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells)\nduring parvovirus infection, it is most dangerous in patients with sickle cell anaemia or\nhereditary spherocytosis, as they are heavily dependent on erythropoiesis due to the\nreduced lifespan of the red cells.",

  "explanation": "Heinz bodies are pathognomic for G6PD deficiency. In PLAB, if you see a question that\nhas Heinz bodies on a blood film, you can almost be certain that this is G6PD\ndeficiency.\nHaemolysis in this case was elicited by treatment of malaria. Usually primaquine is the\nculprit.\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is X-linked and clinically\nimportant cause of oxidant haemolysis. It affects all races but is most common in those\nof African, Asian or Mediterranean descent.\nDeficiency of the G6PD enzyme results in reduced glutathione making the red cells\nvulnerable to oxidative damage and thus liable to haemolysis.\n↓ G6PD enzyme → ↓ glutathione → ↑ red cell susceptibility to oxidative stress\n• Being X-linked, the disease affects mainly men but in areas of high frequency it is\nnot uncommon to find homozygous women. (In the exam, it is usually always male\npatient)\n• Most individuals with the G6PD defect are asymptomatic and unaware of their\nstatus\n• Haemolysis occurs after exposure to oxidants or infection.\n• Acute episodes of haemolysis with fava beans (termed favism)\nThere are many drugs that can elicit haemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. One\ndrug that you would definitely need to look out for in the exam is → antimalarials:\nprimaquine\nPresentation:\n• Most are asymptomatic\n• May be a history of neonatal jaundice, severe enough to require exchange transfusion\n• May have history of drug-induced haemolysis\n• Gallstones are common\n• Pallor from anaemia\n• During a crisis jaundice occurs\n• Back or abdominal pain (usually occurs when >50% haemolysis occurs)\n• Splenomegaly may occur\nThere are typically 4 ways the patient might present in PLAB. Below are the\nspecifics:\nDrug-induced haemolysis in G6PD deficiency\n• Begins 1-3 days after ingestion of drug\n• Anaemia most severe 7-10 days after ingestion\n• Associated with low back and abdominal pain\n• Urine becomes dark (black sometimes)\n• Red cells develop Heinz body inclusions\n• Haemolysis is typically self-limiting\nHaemolysis due to infection and fever\n• 1-2 days after onset of fever\n• Mild anaemia develops\n• Commonly seen in pneumonic illnesses\nFavism\n• Hours/days after ingestion of fava beans (broad beans)\n• Urine becomes red or very dark\n• Shock may develop and it may be fatal\nNeonatal jaundice\n• May develop kernicterus (possible permanent brain damage)\nLaboratory investigation (Important for exam)\n• In steady state (i.e. no haemolysis) the RBCs appear normal\n• Heinz bodies is seen on blood film in drug-induced haemolysis. Bite cells are also\nseen. Bite cells are cells with Heinz bodies that pass through the spleen and have part\nof the membrane removed\nLaboratory investigations (Less important for exam)\n• Spherocytes and RBC fragments on blood film is seen if there is\nsevere haemolysis\n• Increased reticulocytes\n• Increased unconjugated bilirubin\n• decreased haptoglobins\nDiagnosis\nG6PD enzyme activity - is the definitive test\nDiagnosis should not be done during the haemolytic episode but be done during the\nsteady state which is around 6 weeks after the episode of haemolysis. The reason\nbehind this is the diagnosis is difficult during haemolytic episode since reticulocytes\nhave increased levels of enzyme and may get abnormal result.\nManagement\n• Avoidance of precipitating drugs, and broad (fava) beans\n• Transfuse in severe haemolysis or symptomatic anaemia\n• IV fluids to maintain good urine output\n• In infants, exchange transfusion may be required\n• Splenectomy may be of value in severe recurrent haemolysis",

  "explanation": "This is a frequent topic on PLAB 1. Be sure to know the differentiations between all the\nleukaemias and be able to classify them by the age groups. Acute lymphoblastic\nleukaemia (ALL) is the most common paediatric cancer. The differentiating factor\nbetween ALL and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is AML would present with massive\nsplenomegaly on examination. ALL would just have lymphadenopathy.\nBut in actual fact, AML and ALL are usually indistinguishable clinically. This means you\ncannot determine the diagnosis only from the clinical presentation. ALL is more often\nassociated with infiltration of other organs, but AML can do it as well. Acute lymphocytic\nleukaemia (ALL) is more common in children, and acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML)\nis more common in adults\nIt is very unlikely that the PLAB questions would ask you to differentiate the AML from\nALL using specific test.

The leucocytosis is causing the bone pain.\nBleeding from the gum is commonly seen in acute myeloid leukaemia\n(AML).\nNote that gum bleeding can also be seen in ALL.\nAML is the most common acute leukaemia in adults. Thus, majority of the acute\nleukaemia in children questions asked in the PLAB test would be acute lymphoblastic\nleukaemia (ALL) and not acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).\nOne needs to be careful with picking AML or ALL as there are often questions with a\nvery similar stem. In reality, it is difficult to diagnose them clinically as well. Flow\ncytometry (immunophenotyping) is used to help distinguish AML from acute lymphocytic\nleukemia (ALL).\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML)\nThis neoplastic proliferation of blast cells is derived from marrow myeloid elements. It\nprogresses rapidly (death in about 2 months if untreated)\nChildren or young adults may present with acute symptoms over a few days to a few\nweeks.\nMost AML subtypes show more than 30% blasts of a myeloid lineage in the\nblood, bone marrow, or both.\nPresentation:\n• Fatigue, pallor, dizziness and shortness of breath on exertion (symptoms of anaemia)\n• Bleeding caused by thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia often causes petechiae on\nthe lower limbs. DIC may aggravate the situation and cause larger lesions\n• Infection\n• Gingivitis is common, with swollen, bleeding gums\n• There can also be bone pain\n• Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may be found. Lymphadenopathy is less common.\nInvestigations\n• FBC:\n• Total WBC count is often high. However, it may also be normal or even low\n• Neutrophils are usually depleted and blast cells are seen in their place\n• Bone marrow aspiration is the diagnostic procedure.

This usually\nresolves in weeks.\nAnother group of people that you should be worried about parvovirus infections are\npregnant women as they can affect the fetal red blood cells causing aplastic anaemia.\nThe anaemia can be particularly severe due to the short life span of fetal erythrocytes.\nSickle cell crisis\nSickle cell anaemia is characterised by periods of good health with intervening crises\nThere are four main types of crises:\nThrombotic crises (Vaso-occlusive crises)\n• Most common type of crisis\n• Caused by obstruction of the microcirculation by sickled red blood cells, causing\nischaemia\n• Precipitated by cold, infection, or dehydration – Some patients would know their\ntriggers and develop strategies to avoid them however majority of painful episodes\nhave no identifiable cause.\n• Occlusion causes pain which may be severe\n• Infarcts occur in various organs\nCommonly presenting scenarios in exams are\n• Occlusion causing mesenteric ischaemia, mimicking an acute abdomen\n• Avascular necrosis e.g. femoral head\nSequestration crises\n• Is the sudden enlargement of the spleen, causing a decrease in haemoglobin\nconcentration, circulatory collapse and hypovolaemic shock\n• Occurs mainly in babies and young children\n• Occurs mainly in babies and young children\n• Reticulocyte count would be increased\n• Recurrent splenic sequestration is an indication for splenectomy\nAplastic crises\n• Characterized by a rapid drop in haemoglobin level caused by a transient cessation of\nerythropoiesis (production of red blood cells)\n• Leads to a rapid reduction in red cell precursors in the bone marrow and a markedly\nreduced number of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood\n• Caused by an infection with parvovirus B19\nMost patients have a decrease of erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) during\nparvovirus infection, however it is most dangerous in patients with sickle cell anaemia or\nhereditary spherocytosis, as they are heavily dependent on erythropoiesis due to the\nreduced lifespan of the red cells.\nHaemolytic crises\n• Rare thus uncommon to be asked in PLAB\n• During painful crises there may be a marked increase in the rate of haemolysis with a\nfall in the haemoglobin level",

  "question": "A 44 year old HIV positive man complains of a two week history of worsening\nheadache, facial weakness and visual hallucinations. He also reports new onset\nof eye pain.

  "choice_c": "Toxoplasma gondii",
  "choice_d": "Herpes simplex virus",
  "choice_e": "Pneumocystis jirovecii",
  "answer": "Toxoplasma gondii",
  "explanation": "The symptoms and MRI findings here are highly suggestive of toxoplasmosis, a disease\ncaused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii.\nThe reason behind the HIV history is that toxoplasmosis can reactivate in those with\nsevere HIV disease when their CD4 counts are very low ( <50-100/μL).\nPrinciple Manifestations usually include a brain mass lesion, headache, confusion,\nseizures, and focal neurologic deficits. These symptoms occur due to increased\nintracranial pressure. In patients with AIDS, cerebral toxoplasmosis should be right at\nthe top of the list of differentials if one presents with focal neurological symptoms.\nImaging such as CT or MRI scan of the head would show a \"ring\" (contrast) enhancing\nlesion with oedema. Scans may show solitary lesions or cortical atrophy. Given the\nchoice of imaging modality, choose an MRI over a CT as MRI appears to be more\nsensitive than CT in imaging for cerebral toxoplasmosis.\nTOXOPLASMOSIS\nToxoplasma gondii is a protozoa which infects the body via the gastrointestinal tract,\nlung or broken skin. Human infection occurs from consumption of undercooked meat\nor, foot or water contaminated with the oocytes. It's oocysts release trophozoites which\nmigrate widely around the body including to the eye, brain and muscle. The usual\nanimal reservoir is cats where oocytes are produced in the cat’s intestines and shed in\nits faeces.\nInterestingly, toxoplasma gondii is known to remove rats’ fear of cats. Somehow\ninfected rats are mildly attracted to the odour of cats which uninfected rats would usually\nrun away from. This is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation to help toxoplasma\ngondii complete its life cycle: rats are exposed to cat faeces and are infected with\ntoxoplasma gondii. They then lose their innate fear of cats and are more likely to be\neaten by cats. Toxoplasmosis then sexually reproduces in the rat’s gut. This brings\nnew meaning to the term “Eat PrEy, Love”.\nMost infections are asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients usually have a self-limiting\ninfection, often having clinical features resembling infectious mononucleosis (fever,\nmalaise, lymphadenopathy). Other less common manifestations include\nmeningoencephalitis and myocarditis.\nTreatment:\nPyrimethamine plus sulphadiazine",

He especially complained of bilateral calf pain. His past\nhistory is significant for a trip to the Caribbean from which he returned five days\nago. He describes the trip to the Caribbean with his friends as being amazing and\ndescribes a host of activities such as swimming, hiking and fishing.

  "choice_c": "Blood and urine culture and sensitivity",
  "choice_d": "CSF analysis",
  "choice_e": "ELISA for IgM antibodies",
  "answer": "Blood and urine culture and sensitivity",
  "explanation": "This patient is suffering from leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is the most widespread\nzoonotic infection worldwide. The main risk factor for acquiring the infection is direct or\nindirect contact with the urine of infected animals. Contact can occur secondary to\noccupational exposure or accidentally via exposure to unclean sources of water.\nTravelers and athletes participating in water sports, such as those who compete in\ntriathlons, represent a growing population at risk. In the UK, ask for a history of rowing,\nfishing, contact with animals or travel. The red discoloration of the eye seen initially is\nsubconjunctival haemorrhage which occurs in more than 90% of patients with\nleptospirosis. Aminotransferase levels are usually elevated but they are rarely higher\nthan 200 U/L just as seen in this stem.\nThe single most appropriate investigation in this scenarior would be blood and urine\ncultures. This is because leptospirosis can be isolated from blood during the initial\nphase for the first seven to ten days of the disease. Leptospirosis also can be isolated\nfrom urine but this usually occurs in the second stage called “leptospiruric phase” which\nusually occurs after 7 days.\nA CSF analysis is a logical test to do as well however, a CSF analysis would show\nlymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated proteins which are not specifically diagnostic for\nleptospirosis however it can also be cultures to show evidence of leptospirosis.\nNonetheless, a blood culture should be prioritised.\nELISA for IgM antibodies is not the correct option. IgM antibodies can only be detected\nafter the fifth day of illness. ELISA for IgM antibodies can be done after day 5 of patient\npresentation, however it is not the most appropriate test to be done right now.\nThe Paul Bunnell test or the monospot test is a form of the heterophile antibody test. It\nis a rapid test for infectious mononucleosis due to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This\nchoice is therefore incorrect.\nRemember, dark-field examination of blood, urine or CSF can demonstrate leptospira.\nOrganisms can be isolated from blood and CSF in the first week of illness and can be\nisolated in urine samples from 7 days to a month from initial illness.\nMost cases of leptospirosis present as mild, self-limiting, nonspecific febrile illness. If\ntreatment is needed oral doxycycline can be prescribed for mild disease. IF there is\nsevere disease then ampicillin or benzylpenicillin.",

Mumps is a self limiting condition.\nMumps\n• Mumps is an acute, generalised infection caused by a paramyxovirus, usually in\nchildren and young adults\n• It can infect any organ but usually affects the salivary glands\n• The virus is highly infectious with transmission by droplets spread in saliva via close\npersonal contact\n• Infected persons excrete the virus for several days before symptoms appear and for\nseveral days afterwards\nPresentation\n• Mumps can be asymptomatic\n• Nonspecific symptoms lasting a few days, such as fever, headache, malaise, myalgia\nand anorexia, can precede parotitis\n• Parotitis is usually bilateral although it can be unilateral\n• Typically, there is pain at or near the angle of the jaw\n• Fever may be as high as 39.5°C without rigors in small children\n• Swelling causes distortion of the face and neck with skin over the gland hot and\nflushed but there is no rash\n• With severe swelling, the mouth cannot be opened and is dry because the salivary\nducts are blocked.\n• Discomfort lasts for three or four days but may be prolonged when one side clears and\nthe other side swells.\n• Usually just the parotid glands are involved but, rarely, the submaxillary and sublingual\nsalivary glands are affected\nOrchitis\nOrchitis may occur four or five days after the start of parotitis but it often appears\nwithout it. This can sometimes lead to the diagnosis being missed. Orchitis presents\nwith chills, sweats, headache and backache with swinging temperature and severe local\ntesticular pain and tenderness.

The key phrase here is also photophobia which makes\nmeningitis the top of your list of which a lumbar puncture is the method of choice for\ndiagnosis.\nMENINGITIS IN CHILDREN\nChildren with meningitis present with mostly nonspecific symptoms or signs.\nTreatment for meningitis should be started before doing any investigations due to the\nseriousness of the disease.\nThe issue with the exam questions is it is often difficult to identify septicaemia and\nmeningitis whereas in real life you could easily perform both blood cultures and a\nlumbar puncture which would point you towards a diagnosis. The following are some\nways to help differentiate septicaemia and meningitis in children in the exam.\nClinical features Diagnosis\nFever and vomiting Septicaemia, Meningitis\nNon-blanching rash Septicaemia, Meningitis\nDrowsy and confused Septicaemia, Meningitis\nArthralgia and muscle aches Septicaemia\nCold periphery Septicaemia\nPale or mottled skin Septicaemia\nShortness of breath Septicaemia\nSevere headache Meningitis\nStiff neck Meningitis\nPhotophobia Meningitis\nFor exam purposes, a good trick which works most of the time is if the patient has got a\nrash, then perform blood culture as the diagnosis is most likely meningococcal\nsepticaemia. The causative organism is Neisseria meningitides.\nIf there is no rash then a lumbar puncture (LP) would be the answer, but this can only\nbe done if there are no signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP).\nLumbar puncture contraindications to look out for during the exam:\n• Glasgow Coma Scale less than 9 or a drop of 3 points or more\n• Papilloedema\n• Unequal, dilated or poorly responsive pupils\n• Bulging tense fontanelle",

  "answer": "Post-exposure prophylaxis",
  "explanation": "The patient is at risk of acquiring a blood-borne viral infection such as hepatitis B,\nhepatitis C and HIV. The biter is known to be a drug addict, and therefore is at a higher\nrisk of being infected with a blood-borne virus. This wound is considered high risk, and\npost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be started.\nTesting for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV initially is recommended as a baseline test.\nThis gives us clues to whether the police officer is already positive for HIV in which case\nthe management differs. But the more important action is to start PEP as this can\nsignificantly change the outcome of the incident.\nThe police officer will also require follow up serology blood tests at 6 weeks, 3 months\nand 6 months.\nAll human bites should be treated with a 7 day course of oral co-amoxiclav. If the\npatient has a penicillin allergy, metronidazole plus doxycycline, erythromycin or\nclarithromycin.\nHe has had a tetanus booster within the last 5 years and therefore a further booster is\nnot required.\nEXAMPLE OF POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PEP) RISK ASSESSMENT\nThis is an example of how Emergency Departments would perform risk assessment for\npatients who may require PEP. This would differ slightly in every hospital and thus is\nunlikely to be asked in the exam due to the complexity of it.\nPEP Risk Assessment\nNature of incident must involve one of the following:\n• Sharp injury\n• Blood splash to mucous membranes (e.g. eyes/mouth)\n• Contamination of broken skin with blood\n• Bite or Scratch (where skin is visibly broken)\n• Any of the above involving urine or body fluid that is visibly blood stained.\nRisk Assessment\nScore\nNature of exposure Splash to broken skin 1\nSplash to mucous membrane 1\nPercutaneous penetration 2\nType of body fluid Non-bloody body fluid 0\nBloody body fluid 1\nCondition of sharp (if Visibly clean 0\napplicable) Visibly contaminated 1\nType of sharp (if Solid 0\napplicable) Hollow 1\nSharp Use (if Suture/intramuscular/subcutaneous 0\napplicable) Intravenous/arterial access 1\nSource patient Unknown, or known but low risk 0\nKnown but unknown HIV status, but high risk 2\nKnown HIV positive 3\nTotal\nIf total score is 3 or less – Prophylaxis not indicated\nIf total score is 4 to 7 – Consider prophylaxis\nIf total score is 8 to 10 – Offer prophylaxis",

Staphylococcus aureus is usually the\nculprit. Antibiotics can initially be given and if the abscess does not resolve then it may\nneed to be drained. However, given this stem, it is clear that she is unwell and possibly\nseptic and thus oral antibiotics would not be a good option here. Antibiotics need to be\ngiven intravenously, and the abscess needs to be drained.\nMost cases of neck abscess require patients to be hospitalized and intravenous\nantibiotics to be given. Analgesia is also important to relieve pain from the abscess but\nthe option to give oral antibiotics in combination with pain relief is an incorrect one in a\nscenario where the patient is potentially septic.\nDraining of a superficial neck abscess is a simple procedure and is done under general\nanesthesia. Incision and drainage is important as the pus sample collected from the\ndrainage is sent to the laboratory for culture and sensitivity.

  "explanation": "This is a very interesting question with a huge debate between Malaria and\nSchistosomiasis.\nInitially, one may pick Schistosomiasis as Schistosomiasis is widely distributed in udan\nwith more than 5 million people, mostly children, requiring treatment. 5 weeks here fits\nthe timeline of schistosomiasis as symptoms usually takes from four to six weeks from\nthe time of infection. They may feel generally unwell at this point however in majority of\ncases blood in the urine only occurs somewhere between 10 to 12 weeks after the\ninfection. The blood in urine is due to the worms of Schistosoma haematobium\nmigrating to the veins around the bladder and ureters.\nFurthermore, one must remember that bladder involvement is caused by Schistosoma\nhaematobium while Schistosoma mansoni is mainly responsible for intestinal forms of\ndisease. Hepatomegaly is not a clinical feature of infection with Schistosoma\nhaematobium (which causes the bloody urine). It can be seen in infections with\nSchistosoma mansoni but again these are two different infections. Infections with\nSchistosoma mansoni does not cause bloody urine.\nIn short, a patient suffering from urinary schistosomiasis (caused by Schistosoma\nhaematobium) will develop terminal haematuria, while another patient infected with\nSchistosoma mansoni may develop hepatomegaly but ultimately these symptoms are\ncaused by different species.\nConsidering the clinical features, the best answer is Malaria. Blackwater fever is a\ncomplication of malaria infection in which red blood cells burst in the bloodstream\n(haemolysis), releasing hemoglobin directly into the blood vessels and into the urine.\nThis accounts for the dark urine. Malaria is also known to cause hepatomegaly.",

  "question": "A 30 year old woman had unprotected sexual intercourse 48 hours ago with a\nman who is HIV positive and takes antiretroviral therapy. His last viral load a\nweek ago was 1000 copies/mL. What is the SINGLE most appropriate action?",
  "choice_a": "Reassure patient, no action required as sexual partner’s viral load is too",

  "choice_c": "Advise post exposure prophylaxis for 5 days",
  "choice_d": "Advise post exposure prophylaxis for 28 days",
  "choice_e": "Serological testing immediately and wait for results prior to treatment",
  "answer": "Advise post exposure prophylaxis for 28 days",
  "explanation": "Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should always be given for 28 days. Some doctors in\nA&E might give 5 days of PEP and ask the patient to go to sexual clinic to get assessed\nand to be given the remaining 23 days of PEP if required. This is because A&E can be\nbusy at times , and to do a full risk assessment of HIV exposure and council the patient\nmight be difficult hence they throw the decision to someone with more expertise on the\ntopic. However, for the purpose of the exam, always recommend that the duration of\nPEP be 28 days.\nSerological testing immediately is appropriate as a baseline test. This would be the 4th\ngeneration laboratory venous blood HIV test. This can give us clues to whether the\nwoman is already positive for HIV in which case management may be different.\nHowever, we should also start PEP immediately and not wait for results of serology.\nThe viral load in this stem is NOT low. IF the source is on antiretroviral therapy (ART)\nwith a confirmed and sustained (> 6 months) undetectable\nHIV Post-exposure prophylaxis\n• Drugs used in PEP are a combination of oral antiretrovirals to be given as soon as\npossible (i.e. within 1-2 hours, but may be started up to 72 hours following exposure)\nfor 28 days. This reduces the risk of contracting HIV. A few guidelines recommend\nPEP within 48 hours after exposure, but in the UK you can get PEP for up to 72\nhours after exposure, it is just less effective if given late.\n• The first-line regimen is Truvada and Raltegravir for 28 days\n• Follow-up HIV testing is recommended at 8-12 weeks after exposure\nTYPES OF HIV TESTS\nAlways consider the window period!\n4th generation serological testing\n• Detects anti-HIV antibodies and the p24 antigen (a virally-derived protein that is\npresent in the early stages of HIV infection before antibodies do)\n• Window period for this test is 4 weeks\n• Detects majority of individuals who have been infected with HIV at one month (4\nweeks) after specific exposure.\n• Recommended in the BHIVA/BASHH/BIS UK guidelines for HIV testing\n• If negative, still need to offer HIV serology test at 12 weeks to confirm negative\nresults.\nPoint of care testing\n• Uses capillary blood (finger prick) or saliva (mouth swab) – Sample do not need to\nbe sent to a laboratory and results will be available within a few minutes\n• Measures anti-HIV antibodies\n• Has a lower specificity and sensitivity compared with 4th generation serological\ntesting\n• The window period is up to 12 weeks but the result is available within minutes\n• Offer in situations where venepuncture is declined or difficult to give people results\nof test (e.g. unwilling to leave contact details)\n• If positive or ‘reactive’ (non-negative), will need to be confirmed by serological\ntesting.\nHome self-sampling kit\n• Kits ordered online\n• Saliva sample or capillary blood (finger prick) is taken at home by patient and sent\noff in the post for testing\nHome self-teting kit\n• Kits ordered online\n• Saliva sample or capillary blood (finger prick) is taken at home by patient and tested\nat home\n• Results will be available within minutes",

  "choice_e": "Current Hepatitis C virus infection",
  "answer": "Current Hepatitis C virus infection",
  "explanation": "Option E. Current Hepatitis C virus infection is the correct answer given that the\nserology is indicative of likely resolved hepatitis B infection as well as presence of HCV\nRNA. The histopathological findings in this case are helpful to you if you can remember\nthis from your early days in medical school, however the serology is enough to get the\nanswer. So don’t be thrown by details like this. Given that the patient is an intravenous\ndrug user, you should consider blood borne viruses. Remember hepatitis C is\nassociated with cirrhosis and eventual hepatocellular carcinoma.\nOption A. Past Cytomegalovirus infection is not correct as there is no indication in the\nstem or the results that this infection is present.\nOption B. Current Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection is not correct as there is no\nindication in the stem regarding HIV infection although it is a blood borne virus.\nTherefore it is tehre to try to confuse you.\nOption C. Previous Hepatitis E virus infection is not the correct answer as there is no\nmention of hepatitis E virus in the results and this is usually transmitted via faecal-oral\nroute in less developed countries. There is no indication of this in the question.\nOption D. Current Hepatitis B virus infection is not the correct answer as the blood test\nresults show an equivocal test result which is commonly due to resolved infection. This\nis very probable in this case as this is a blood borne infection and this patient has a\nmajor risk factor for contracting this in her lfe. A relatively low proportion (around 5%) of\npeople with hepatitis B progress to chronic infection.",

Some GUM\nclinics perform microscope or laboratory test on a skin ulcer sample if the ulcer is\npresent however the most important test for syphilis is carried out on a blood sample.\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dark field microscopy can only be carried out from\na sample of the lesion or an infected lymph node. Since the ulcer is healed, a sample\ncannot be obtained.\nIf there was an ulcer visible, a dark field microscopy would allow a point of care syphilis\ndiagnosis. The GUM physician would visualize the live treponemes, obtained from a\nvariety of cutaneous or mucous membrane lesions while in the clinic and could treat the\npatient right there and then. This obviously has a huge advantage. However if the\npatient presents to a GP surgery, a PCR would be performed as GPs do not have\nfacilities or capabilites to perform a dark field microscopy. So the answer for most\nappropriate investigations of syphilis if a patient presents with an ulcer would depend on\nwhich type of clinic he visits – a GP surgery or a GUM clinic.\nA midstream urine sample would detect a urinary tract infection, not a sexual\ntransmitted disease.",

  "explanation": "Basic first aid for needle stick injuries includes washing with soap under running water\nand encouraging bleeding in that area. When there is a needle stick injury to health\ncare professionals, occupational health must be contacted.\nThe patient should be informed that there has been a needle stick injury and permission\nshould be asked prior to taking bloods for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen\nand hepatitis C virus antibodies. The reason for consent is to ensure that the patient is\ngiven appropriate information about the implications of the test if they come back\npositive.\nThe patient is considered low risk, therefore post-exposure prophylaxis is not necessary\nfor the surgeon.\nIn this case, hepatitis B surface antigen blood test for the surgeon would suffice.\nHepatitis C virus and HIV antibodies are usually not indicated at time of injury as it takes\ntime for the antibodies to develop if the surgeon gets infected. The serum is stored for\nfuture use if required.\nAdditional information: The surgeon should return in 6 weeks for a full set of seroloogy\nwhich now incudes hepatitis C virus and HIV antibodies. If this comes back negative,\nand the patient’s initial blood test was also negative, the surgeon can be discharged\nwith no further follow up. If for any reason, the patient did not provide consent for\nbloods to be taken, then the surgeon would need to have his bloods tested immediately\nafter the injury, at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks.\nAnother take-home point is that the surgeon should be offered a hepatitis B booster as\nhe has been previously immunised but unable to remember when was the last booster\nhe received.\nAdditional information: A useful mnemonic to remember is the rule of “3” when it\ncomes to needle stick injuries. The rates of transmission to the recipient following\ninnoculation of blood through a hollow bore needle are as follows:\n• 0.3% if the donor is HIV-positive\n• 3% if the donor is hepatitis C antibody-positive\n• 30% if the donor is hepatitis B surface antigen positive",

  "explanation": "This patient here has attained severe crush injuries which has lead to rhabdomyolysis\nwhich results from skeletal muscle breakdown, with release of its contents, one of which\nis myoglobin into the circulation. Myogloglbin has heme which results in a positive\ndipstick for blood. Myoglobin is nephrotoxic and can cause a worsening acute kidney\ninjury. It is important to rehydrate the patient to decrease the duration of contact\nbetween myoglobin and the kidney tubules.\nRHABDOMYOLYSIS\nRhabdomyolysis results from skeletal muscle breakdown, with release of its contents\ninto the circulation, including myoglobin, potassium, phosphate, urate and creatinine\nkinase (CK).\nAetiology\n• Suden, severe crush injury\n• Status epilepticus\n• Severe exertion\nImportant presentations to remember for the exam\n• Elderly patient with history of fall followed by long duration on the floor\n• Mountain biker rescued from being trapped under heavy rocks for many hours\n• Trapped under a fallen wardrobe for several hours\n• IV drug user found on floor not moving for a few days\n• Marathon runner who just completed a long-distance run\nTwo complications you need to remember for rhabdomyolysis\n• Acute kidney injury\n• Hyperkalaemia\nThere is often enough pigment release in the bloodstream to cause nephrotoxicity. The\ndegree of toxicity is related to the duration of contact of the tubular cells with myoglobin.\nThis toxicity is compounded by dehydration as well. Example, a person who has run a\nmarathon has both myoglobin release as well as poor kidney perfusion. Both\ndehydration and release of myoglobin increase the risk of acute kidney injury.\nOne of the most important complications to recognise for rhabdomyolysis is\nhyperkalaemia and thus rhabdomyolysis is often a medical emergency.\nLaboratory testing\nThe most important test when there has been a severe crush injury and the\nrhabdomyolysis is potentially life threatening is an ECG or potassium level.\nThis implies that you know how a patient with rhabdomyolysis will die. Acidosis and\nhyperkalemia can lead to an arrhythmia. If there are peaked T-waves on the ECG, you\nwill give calcium chloride or calcium gluconate.\nThe best initial test that is specific for rhabdomyolysis is a urinalysis in which you find a\ndipstick that is positive for blood but in which no red cells are seen. This is a False +ve\ndipstick haematuria. This is because myoglobin can react with the reagent on the\ndipstick and come out as if there were red cells present. Hemoglobin will do the same\nthing. The dipstick of the urinalysis cannot distinguish among hemoglobin, myoglobin,\nand red blood cells. This is because myoglobin has heme in it.\nRhabdomyolysis is confirmed with a markedly elevated serum CPK level. Elevated\nserum CPK is a biochemical marker of skeletal muscle neurosis.\nRhabdomyolysis is associated with a very rapidly rising creatinine level. This is because\nof both renal failure as well as the massive release of muscle products.\nTreatment\n• Calcium chloride/gluconate.\no If there are ECG abnormalities from the hyperkalaemia the best initial therapy is\ncalcium chloride or gluconate\n• Intravenous fluid rehydration\no Priority to prevent AKI.\no This decreases the duration of contact between the nephrotoxic myoglobin and\nthe kidney tubule.\n• Intravenous sodium bicarbonate\no Used to alkalinize urine to pH >6.5, to stabilize a less toxic form of myoglobin\no Alkalinizing the urine with bicarbonate may help prevent the precipitation of the\npigment in the tubule\n• Dialysis\no Only needed in severe cases",

This patient has AKI, a very large stone which is\nclearly obstructive uropathy, and therefore urgent percutaneous nephrostomy is\nindicated.\nPERCUTANEOUS NEPHROSTOMY\nThis is used as a temporary relief of ureteric obstruction where ureteric stones fail to\nrespond to analgesics and where renal function is impaired due to the stone. It is an\nintervention that decompresses the renal collecting system by placing a catheter,\nthrough the skin, into the kidney, under local anaesthetic. This catheter allows the urine\nto drain from the kidney into a collecting bag, outside the body. Another method that is\noften used to relieve ureteric obstruction is an insertion of a JJ stent.\nThe function of a percutaneous nephrostomy is to bypass the ureteric obstruction and\ntherefore relieve the pain associated with the obstruction.\nThe percutaneous nephrostomy tube can restore efficient peristalsis to the ureteric wall\nand in some cases this allows the stone to pass down and out of the ureter with the\nnephrostomy in situ, however in many instances, it simply sits where it is and\nsubsequent definitive management to remove the stone is still required.",

Creatine kinase is the investigation used to help diagnose this and\nrhabdomyolysis can result in severe acute kidney injury with life threatening\nhyperkalaemia if left untreated as well as peramanent kidney damage. Given that the\npatient had been seen two days ago he may have been laying on the floor for up to two\ndays which is a very high risk of rhabdomyolysis.

A full blood count is incorrect. Although this may be useful to us in some\nway, in this case it is not the single best answer as it does not direct our steps in\nmanagement greatly or help us find a cause for this presentation or address the main\nconcern in this patient which is the acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis.\nOption B.

It is worth mentioning that prerenal is the most common\ncause of acute kidney injury in children and it would usually occur from hypovolaemia.\nAcute kidney injury (AKI), formerly referred to as acute renal failure (ARF), is seen as an\nacute reduction in kidney function that results in a decline in glomerular filtration rate\n(GFR) leading to retention of urea and other nitrogenous waste products.

On\nexamination, she appears to be confused and has a three hour history of nausea\nand vomiting. She has decreased skin turgor and is found to be oliguric. Her\nserum lab values are as follows:\nUrea: 15 mmol/L\nCreatinine: 210 micromol/L\nCreatine kinase: 21223 U/L\nWhat is the SINGLE most likely reason for her increased creatine kinase levels?",

  "choice_e": "Dementia",
  "answer": "Rhabdomyolysis",
  "explanation": "The answer that best fits in with this patient’s signs and symptoms is rhabdomyolysis.\nShe has an acute kidney injury secondary to rhabdomyolysis which was caused by her\nhistory of frequent falls.\nThe clincher in this stem is the markedly raised serum creatinine kinase, which, in\nrhabdomyolysis, is often raised to over 10,000.\nOne must remember that you do not need to have a crushing injury for rhabdomyolysis\nto occur. It can also occur after a fall if left for a long period of time on the floor which\ncould also cause muscle breakdown. There is no history in this stem of being on the\nfloor for long duration of time, but one would have to assume so as there is not a better\noption given as an answer.\nSome may argue that dermatomyositis may also cause a raised creatinine kinase that is\nsometimes 50 times more than normal and she could have fallen down frequently due\nto proximal muscle weakness. However, this stem does not include any skin\nmanifestations like Gottron’s papules or heliotrope rash which are often seen in stems\nwhere the answer would be dermatomyositis. Furthermore, the exam writers would\nalways take into consideration which is a more important diagnosis NOT to miss. If you\nmiss a diagnosis of dermatomyositis in A&E, no one would penalize you.

  "choice_c": "Iatrogenic",
  "choice_d": "Liver failure",
  "choice_e": "Acute kidney injury",
  "answer": "Iatrogenic",
  "explanation": "Option C. Iatrogenic is the correct answer as these results are likely due to too much of\nan inappropriate fluid being prescribed such as 5% dextrose. In the presence of sepsis\na fluid like Hartmann’s or 0.9% sodium chloride is more appropriate as it will help\nreplace intravascular volume without dilution or fluid shifts that occur when using a fluid\nlike dextrose. Avoid using such kinds of fluids in the setting of sepsis as they do more\nharm.\nOption A. Hypertension is incorrect as high blood pressure does nto cause\nhyponatraemia. In fact, hypernatraemia can result in a raised blood pressure in certain\nendocrine problems.\nOption B. Sepsis is incorrect as this alone is not likely to cause low sodium. There are\ncertain infections such as atypical respiratory infections like legionella that can result in\nhyponatraemia. In this question, they explicitly state this is an abdominal sepsis.\nOption D. Liver failure is not correct as there is no indication in this scenario of any liver\nsymptoms. Although the patient has abdominal sepsis, which is usually biliary sepsis,\nthere is no mention of any signs of liver disease such as jaundice, and there are no\nblood test results that demonstrate deranged liver function.\nOption E. Acute kidney injury is incorrect as the creatinine and urea are shown to be\nnormal in this case.

It is a\nradiological, functional, or pathological diagnosis or description.\nCauses\n• Renal scarring due to previous infection\n• Long-term effects of VUR, with or without superimposed infection\n• A child with VUR, particularly where there is reflux of infected urine, will develop\nreflux nephropathy (which, if bilateral, may cause renal impairment or renal failure).\nIf the child’s kidneys are examined radiologically, the radiologist will describe the\nappearances as those of ‘chronic pyelonephritis’.\n• An adult may also develop radiological features of chronic pyelonephritis due to the\npresence of reflux combined with high bladder pressures, again particularly where\nthe urine is infected.\nPresentation\n- Patients may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms secondary to renal failure.\n- Diagnosis is often from incidental findings during general investigation.\n- There is usually no active infection.\nAppearances on imaging\n- Renal ultrasound may show small kidneys with a thin cortex\n- Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) may show small kidneys, ureteric and caliceal\ndilatation/blunting with cortical scarring\n- Micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) may help to identify reflux.\n- Technetium-99m Tc-DMSA scan is the most sensitive for demonstration of renal\nscars.\nManagement\n• Aim to investigate and treat any infection, prevent further UTI, and monitor and\noptimize renal function\n• Blood pressure should be controlled to slow the progression of chronic kidney\ndisease. Ideally using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\n• Severe underlying VUR diagnosed in children may require antibiotics\nprophylactically until puberty or until the reflux resolves",

It is important to\nnote that dipstick proteinuria has a prevalence of around 5% in healthy individuals which\nis usually a trace to 1+ range. Urine dipsticks also may have a false positive result.\nEvents in which a false positive can occur on urinalysis include alkaline urine, if the\ndipstick is immersed too long, with highly concentrated urine, or in the presence of pus,\nsemen or vaginal secretions. Remember as well that an important cause of transient\nproteinuria is exercise. This patient is a gym instructor and, as such, would be\nexercising a lot. Since this patient is otherwise healthy and has no outward indicator of\nhaving renal disease, the most approprate next step for this patient would be to repeat\nthe urine dipstick test.

You should never refer isolated proteinuria\nwithout investigating further.\nAdvising this patient to reduce the amount of protein in her diet is the blatantly wrong\nchioce here.

  "answer": "Cerebral oedema",
  "explanation": "This patient has hyponatraemia leading to cerebral oedema. Cerebral oedema is\ndefined as an excess in the accumulation of fluid in the intracellular or extracellular\nspaces of the brain and there are various causes for this phenomenon, but there are\ntypically four types that can be seen in clinical practice. The important type to\nconcentrate on for this question is the osmotic type.\nWhen plasma is diluted, such as in hyponatraemic states, it creates an abnormal\npressure gradient between the brain’s internal environment and the serum. This causes\nthe movement of water into the brain. This patient has clear hyponatraemia as\nevidenced by her lab values. An important cause of hyponatraemia is hhigh blood\nsugar and iatrogenic administration of a hypotonic solution. This patient has been\nreceiving a hypotonic solution and 5% of intravenous dextrose for an extended period of\ntime. This would naturally increase her blood glucose levels and dilute her intracellular\nvolume leading to hyponatraemia. For this reason sodium chloride 0.9% is usually used\ninstead of hypotonic solutions.\nOsmotic shrinkage of the brain describes the end result of osmotherapy whereby the\novlume of intracranial fluid is reduced by shifting fluid out of the brain and into the\nserum. An example of this type of therapy is administering intravenous mannitol to\nreduce intracranial pressure. This answer is incorrect as it is the opposite of what the\nquestion asks for.\nCerebral demyelination describes any condition that causes the myelin sheath of\nneurons to become damaged. Although a presenting symptom of demyelination is\nweakness, this answer is not corect since this patient does not present with the host of\nsigns and symptoms that can be seen in demyelinating diseases which can be anything\nfrom diplopia to speech problems. A common iatrogenic cause of cerebral\ndemyelination is central pontine myelinolysis which is caused by rapid correction of low\nblood sodium levels.\nCytotoxicity is incorrect since the stem gives no clue as to any cytotoxic drug that this\npatient might have taken. An importat cytotoxic drug to remember for the exam is\nisoniazid, which can lead to cerebral oedema.\nReye’s syndrome describes a rapidly progressive encephalopathy which usually\npresents with liver toxicity, personality changes, confusion and even seizures. The\ncause is unknown, but viral infections are thought to play a role. This answer is\nincorrect since there is no clue in the stem that alludes to the patient having had a viral\ninfection nor are her liver function test results included.",

If we cannot be certain of this period, we cannot proceed to give alteplase.\nFirstly, there was no time given in the stem. Secondly, the patient woke up to symptoms\nof a stroke. The ischaemic event could have happen anytime during the night.\nWarfarin → anticoagulants should not be started until brain imaging has excluded\nhaemorrhage, and usually not until 14 days have passed from the onset of an ischaemic\nstroke\nStreptokinase → Note that the NHS prefers alteplase over streptokinase. So\nstreptokinase is almost never the right answer.\nStatins → Statins need to be offered but this is not the most appropriate next course of\naction. There is no urgency in giving statins.\nDipyridamole → Can be given, but it is usually only given If clopidogrel is\ncontraindicated or not tolerated. In such case we would give a combination of modified-\nrelease dipyridamole and low dose aspirin.\nStroke management\nSummary of management of acute stroke:\n• blood glucose, hydration, oxygen saturation and temperature should be maintained\nwithin normal limits\n• aspirin 300mg orally or rectally should be given as soon as possible if a\nhaemorrhagic stroke has been excluded\n• Thrombolysis should only be given if it is administered within 4.5 hours of onset of\nstroke symptoms and haemorrhagic stroke has been excluded by imaging (Alteplase\nis currently recommended by NICE)\nPost management stroke\n• Aspirin 300 mg daily for 2 weeks is given immediately after an ischaemic stroke is\nconfirmed by brain imaging.\n• Clopidogrel 75 mg daily is then given long-term\n• If clopidogrel is contraindicated or not tolerated, give a combination of modified-\nrelease dipyridamole and low dose aspirin.\n• Ensure a statin has been offered.\nKEY POINTS FOR MANAGEMENT OF TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (TIA) AND\nSTROKE\nTIA Stroke\nAspirin immediately (give 300 mg), and continue Aspirin 300 mg daily for 2 weeks is given\ndaily (Most would reduce to 75 mg/swap to immediately after an ischaemic stroke is confirmed\nclopidogrel after 2 weeks) by brain imaging\nClopidogrel (75 mg daily) is the preferred long- Clopidogrel 75 mg daily is then given long-term\nterm antiplatelet for secondary prevention for secondary prevention\n• If clopidogrel is contraindicated or not tolerated, • If clopidogrel is contraindicated or not tolerated,\ngive a combination of modified-release give a combination of modified-release\ndipyridamole (200 mg twice daily) and low dose dipyridamole (200 mg twice daily) and low dose\naspirin aspirin\n• And again if this is not tolerated use either • And again if this is not tolerated use either\naspirin or dipyridamole alone aspirin or dipyridamole alone\nEnsure a statin (usually Atorvastatin 80 mg) has Ensure a statin (usually Atorvastatin 80 mg) has\nbeen offered as soon as possible after a TIA. been offered\nAlso ensure good blood pressure control (but not in Also ensure good blood pressure control (but not in\nthe first 48 h) the first 48 h)\nNote: For those already taking low-dose aspirin Note: After a haemorrhagic stroke, blood pressure\nregularly, you do not have to increase thedose to control is still critical but antiplatelets and statins\n300 mg.

In the interim, aspirin 300 mg daily can be used\no Atrial fibrillation absent:\n▪ Give clopidogrel 75 mg OD for long-term prevention of ischaemic events\n• If intolerant of Clopidogrel, give Aspirin 75 mg OD plus Dipyridamole MR\n200 mg BD\no And again if this is not tolerated use either aspirin or dipyridamole\nalone\n▪ Note: For acute treatment of ischaemic stroke give 300 mg of Aspirin for 2\nweeks\n• Lifestyle advice\no Low salt diet\no Low cholesterol diet\no Weight loss\no Alcohol reduction\no Smoking cessation\nLastly, always consider carotid endarterectomy as secondary prevention in\nischaemic stroke\n• Carotid duplex is done as part of work up at TIA clinic to consider carotid\nendarterectomy if internal carotid artery is stenosed (stenosis is ≥ 50% in men, ≥\n70% in women)\no Guidelines recommend this should be done within 2 weeks of admission (SIGN &\nNICE)\nSpecial key notes from SIGN guidelines regarding secondary prevention after\nhaemorrhagic strokes:\n• BP conrrol is important\n• Do not offer antiplatelets, unless at high risk of a cardiac event\n• Statins are not recommended",

It is seen vagus nerve lesions, and may be associated with\ndysphonia.\nBulbar Palsy\nBulbar relates to the medulla. Bulbar palsy is the result of diseases affecting the lower\ncranial nerves (VII-XII). A speech deficit occurs due to paralysis or weakness of the\nmuscles of articulation which are supplied by these cranial nerves.\nBulbar palsy is sometimes also classified as non-progressive or progressive:\n• Non-progressive bulbar palsy is an uncommon condition of uncertain aetiology and\nthere are few reports of it in the literature.\n• Progressive bulbar palsy can occur in children or adults and form a spectrum of\nseverity. Progressive bulbar palsy is more common in elderly women. Starts of with\ndysarthria and/or dysphagia. Note: dysphagia without dysarthria is very unusual. The\nlimb involvement comes later, perhaps in a couple of year.

  "explanation": "Motor neuron disease (MND). This picture is of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with bulbar\nonset.\nIn MND, motor nerves become damaged and eventually stop working. Therefore, the\nmuscles that the damaged nerves supply gradually lose their strength. There are\nvarious subtypes of MND. In each type, symptoms tend to start in different ways.\nHowever, as the disease progresses, the symptoms of each type of MND tend to\noverlap. This means that symptoms in the later stages of each type of MND become\nsimilar. The main types of MND are:\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This is the classical MND and the most common\ntype. About 8 in 10 people with MND have this type. Symptoms tend to start in the\nhands and feet. The muscles tend to become stiff as well as weak at first.\nProgressive bulbar palsy (PBP). About 2 in 10 people with MND have this type. The\nmuscles first affected are those used for talking, chewing and swallowing (the bulbar\nmuscles).\nProgressive muscular atrophy (PMA). This is an uncommon form of MND. The small\nmuscles of the hands and feet are usually first affected but the muscles are not stiff.\nPrimary lateral sclerosis (PLS). This is a rare type of MND. It mainly causes weakness\nin the leg muscles. Some people with this type may also develop clumsiness in the\nhands or develop speech problems.\nThe subtypes for PLAB are not so important as they are unlikely to be asked. The only\nsubtype that has potential in being asked is Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nPresentation:\n• Progressive weakness of bulbar, limb, thoracic and abdominal muscles\n• Oculomotor, sphincter, cognitive functions are usually spared\n• Late stages - swallowing difficulty and hoarseness\nDiagnosis:\n• Clinical diagnosis via diagnostic criteria by EFNS guidelines\nTreatment:\n• Multidisciplinary care\n• Neuroprotective medication: riluzole\n• Medications to treat respiratory symptoms, drooling, insomnia, fatigue, and\npsychological symptoms\n• Genetic testing and counseling for family\nCOMPARING GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME, MYASTHENIA GRAVIS AND MOTOR\nNEURON DISEASE\nIt is important to differentiate Guillain-Barre syndrome, Myasthenia Gravis and\nMotor Neuron disease.

If someone with neglect is\nasked to draw a clock, their drawing might show only the numbers 12 to 6, or all 12\nnumbers might be on one half of the clock face with the other half distorted or blank.\nNeglect patients may also ignore the contralesional side of their body; for instance, they\nmight only shave, or apply makeup to, the nonneglected side.

  "explanation": "PLAB 1 questions are usually very straight-forward. They would usually only ask\ndiagnosis, investigation, and management. However occasionally, there would be a few\nodd questions where they would ask for the mechanism behind certain pathology. In\nthis case stem, the patient has a history of prostate carcinoma; therefore, the symptoms\npresented here would most likely indicate metastasis/tumour that is compressing on the\ncauda equina. Option B would produce a degree of voiding dysfunction but not in the\ninitiation of voiding and there would not be sensory changes. Option D although\npossible will not produce severe back pain or perineal numbness.\nCauda Equina syndrome\nPresentation:\n- Severe back pain\n- Groin numbness / “saddle distribution sensory loss”\n- Difficulty to initiate voiding\n- Urinary or faecal incontinence\n- Distal motor weakness\nDiagnosis:\n- MRI spine\nTreatment:\n- This is a neurosurgical emergency and needs neurosurgery referral",

Her pulse\nrate is 88 beats/minute and her blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg. A non-contrast\nCT of the head shows a large intra-axial space occupying lesion with surrounding\noedema and mass effect.

  "choice_c": "Levetiracetam",
  "choice_d": "Radiotherapy",
  "choice_e": "Urgent decompressive craniotomy and tumour resection",
  "answer": "High dose dexamethasone",
  "explanation": "The imaging features are consistent with cerebral metastases which likely originated\nfrom the breast by haematogenous spread.\nThe key treatment components of patients with cerebral metastasis revolves around the\ncontrol of peritumoral oedema and control of high intracranial pressure of which\ncorticosteroids does the trick. Majority of peritumoral oedema and cerebral tumours\nresponds well with corticosteroids (usually dexamethasone). Corticosteroid treatment\nreduces intracranial pressure and improves neurological symptoms within hours.\nHeadaches tend to resolve and if neurological deficits were present, they would also\nimprove with the maximum benefit seen in around 24 to 72 hours.\nIn regards to image modality, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast would\nbe more appropriate than a computed tomography (CT) to look for cerebral tumours as\nit is more sensitive however in emergency settings like the above. CT scans are usually\nperformed to look for any intracranial bleeding.\nMannitol which is an osmotic diuretic is used in emergency scenarios where rapid\ndecrease of intracranial pressure is required. These would include situations where the\nGCS is less than 8, a history of head trauma, or fixed unilateral or bilateral pupils.\nAntiseizure drugs like levetiracetam are not generally recommended in patients who\nhave never had a seizure although they do have a place in prophylactic management\nfor patients undergoing craniotomy for tumour resection.\nA neurosurgical evaluation for surgical intervention would be eventually required\nhowever as the patient is clinically stable, this would not be the best next step.",

She takes\nsodium valproate for her epilepsy which has been well controlled and has been\nseizure free for the past year. She and her husband have been using condoms as\ncontraception till present. She attends clinic seeking advice regarding her\nantiepileptic medication as she would like to get pregnant. What is the SINGLE\nmost appropriate advice to give?",

  "choice_d": "Reduce the dose of sodium valproate",

  "answer": "Change sodium valproate to carbamazepine",
  "explanation": "Change to carbamazepine is the best option given the options provided. If there was an\noption that said, change to carbamazepine and add folic acid 5mg, that would be an\neven better answer.\nOne would not stop antiepileptic medication especially if the patient has only be seizure\nfree for one year. The patient needs to be seizure free for more than 2 years before it\nwould be considered reasonable to stop antiepileptic medication prior to pregnancy.\nEpilepsy and pregnancy\nPre-pregnancy\nIf a woman is taking antiepileptic drugs and planning a pregnancy, the general advice to\ngive to her is about the increased risks of fetal malformations, neurodevelopmental\ndelay, and possible increased seizure frequency in pregnancy.\nSince there is no agreement as to which antiepileptic drug is most or least teratogenic,\nthe antiepileptic drug that stops seizures in a given patient is the one that should be\nused. However, there is one exception to the rule, SODIUM VALPROATE! The risk of\nteratogenicity with Valproate is greater than risk of teratogenicity with other antiepileptic\ndrugs. Hence, sodium valproate should always be changed to another antiepileptic drug\nprior to pregnancy. Currently, carbamazepine and lamotrigine has good safety profiles\nbut again there is no consensus as to which should be used.\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a special\nreminder on the risk of neurodevelopmental delay in children following maternal use of\nsodium valproate, and advises that this drug should not be used in women of\nchildbearing potential unless there is no effective alternative.\nHigh dose (5mg) folic acid is recommended for at least 1 month preconceptually and\nthroughout the first trimester.\nIn established pregnancy\nIn established pregnancy, changes to alternate antiepileptic drug therapy should NOT\nbe undertaken solely to reduce teratogenic risk for 2 reasons :\n1. Changing AEDs may precipitate seizures\n2. Overlapping AEDs during the change exposes the fetus to effects of an additional\nantiepileptic drugs\nOnce an unplanned pregnancy is discovered it is usually too late for changes to be\nmade to the epilepsy treatment regimen. The risk of harm to the mother and fetus from\nconvulsive seizures outweighs the risk of continued therapy",

It includes the midbrain, the medulla oblongata and the pons.\nSince this patient is experiencing deficits in her trigeminal nerve (CN V) and her\nvestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), this answer makes the most sense.\nNone of the other choices would cause the patient to present with her particular set of\nsigns and symptoms.\nCerebral cortex is not the correct answer as this usually results in unilateral symptoms\nin the limbs that are predominantly weakness and loss of sensation. Incoordination is\nnot usually even possible to check in these cases as there is such a degree of loss of\nfunction.\nSpinal cord is not the correct answer as usually when the spinal cord is affected, there\nare symptoms present from the level of the cord affected and below.

  "answer": "Space occupying lesion",
  "explanation": "This boy has just had a complex partial seizure. The term “partial” (or focal) seizure\nmeans that the electrical activity was limited to a part of one cerebral hemisphere. The\nterm “complex” seizure means there was loss of awareness. The seizure is likely\ncaused by a the lesion seen on the CT scan that is occupying space.\nLess likely answers\nEpilepsy - is incorrect as the termed epilepsy would require at least two unprovoked\nseizures occurring more than 24 hours apart for the definition to fall into place.\nDementia - is incorrect as dementia is a brain disorder causing memory loss and\ndecline in cognition. It occurs in the elderly and does not cause seizures.\nHuntington’s chorea - is also incorrect. Firstly, symptoms of Huntington’s disease\nbecome noticeable between ages of 35 and 44 years old. This boy is too young to\ndevelop symptoms of Huntington’s disease. Secondly, Huntington’s chorea is\ncharacterised by jerky, random and uncontrolled movements. During these movements,\nthere is no loss of consciousness.\nRaised intracranial pressure (intracranial hypertension) - is also not entirely wrong\nhowever it should be picked only if there was no option for space occupying lesion.\nRaised intracranial pressure does occur when there is a space occupying lesion. The\nsymptoms of raised intracranial pressure include headaches, double vision, drowsy,\nirritable and the occasional seizures however because the term intracranial\nhypertension is such a broad term which also incorporates other aetiologies such as\nbrain trauma, meningitis, aneurysm rupture and others, it would be better to pick a more\nspecific term like space occupying lesion as the cause of the seizure in this question.",

  "explanation": "Knowing the contents of the ABCD2 and the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system is not\nnecessary for the PLAB 1 exam but knowing when to apply each scoring system is vital.\nABCD2 score\nThe ABCD2 score is to assess risk of future stroke in the next 7 days in patients who\nhave already suffered from a transient ischaemic attack (TIA). After a TIA, early\nrecurrent stroke is common. Around 10-15% have a second TIA/CVA in the first week\noften within the first 48 hours. Assessment of this risk using the ABCD2 score is\nimportant for physicians to take action as indicated.\nAn example of use of a ABCD2 score is a patient presenting to A&E or a GP surgery\nwith symptoms of a TIA. The ABCD2 score helps the physician decide on how to\nmanage the patient. If the patient scored high on the ABCD2 score, the physician would\nrefer the patient for specialist assessment within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms,\ngive a statin and give an antiplatelet drug if the patient is not already taking any\nanticoagulation medication. This management would reduce the risk of developing\nstroke occurring in the next 7 days.\nCHA2DS2-VASc score\nThe CHA2DS2-VASc score is to assess the risk of future stroke in patients who have\natrial fibrillation. This score is then used to determine whether or not treatment is\nrequired with anticoagulation therapy.\nRemember:\nABCD2 = Risk of future stroke following TIA in view of how soon to refer to a\nspecialist\nCHA2DS2-VASc = Risk of future stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation in view of\nnecessity of anticoagulation therapy",

  "answer": "Immediate referral to orthopaedic surgeon",
  "explanation": "This is a classic example of cauda equina syndrome. It is a serious neurologic condition\nin which damage to the cauda equina causes loss of function of the nerve roots of the\nspinal canal below the termination (conus medullaris) of the spinal cord. Any lesion\nwhich compresses or disturbs the function of the cauda equina may disable the nerves\nalthough the most common is a central disc prolapse.\nSpinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome are neurological emergencies that\nrequire immediate referral and intervention.\nThe management of true cauda equina syndrome frequently involves surgical\ndecompression.\nPain due to a herniated lumbosacral disc may settle within six weeks. If it does not, or\nthere are red flag signs such as the possibility of cauda equina syndrome like in this\ncase, referral to an orthopaedic surgeon or a neurosurgeon should be considered.\nRed flags that suggest cauda equina syndrome include:\n• Severe or progressive bilateral neurological deficit of the legs, such as major motor\nweakness with knee extension, ankle eversion, or foot dorsiflexion\n• Recent-onset urinary retention and/or urinary incontinence (caused by loss of\nsensation when passing urine).\n• Recent-onset faecal incontinence (due to loss of sensation of rectal fullness)\n• Perianal or perineal sensory loss (saddle anaesthesia or paraesthesia)",

  "explanation": "The reason combined hormonal contraception is not used in patients with migraine with\naura is that they have a 2-4 time added risk of cerebrovascular accident.\nIt is quite important to remember the differences between migraines with and without\nauras. Auras can be described as warning signs before the headache begins.\nAura characteristics:\n• Occurs before the onset of headache\n• Lasts 5 to 60 minutes\n• Visual symptoms (homonymous hemianopia, fortified spectra, scotoma), unilateral\nparaesthesia or weakness, dysphasia\n• Headache either begins before the end of the aura or wtihin an hour of the end\nMIGRAINE WITH AURA, CONTRACEPTION AND UKMEC\nWhen discussing contraception, it is always important to understand the basics of the\nUK Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (UKMED). The UKMEC offers\nguidance to prescribers in regards to prescribing suitable contraception taking into\naccount the risks and benefits of individual contraception. A UKMEC category of 1\nmeans that this contraception is safe and can beused without restrictions whereas a\nUKMEC category of 4 represents an absolute contraindication due to unacceptable risk.\nMigraine with aura is an absolute contraindication to usingthe combined oral\ncontraceptive pill due to an increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents (UKMEC 4)\nThe levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (Mirena ® IUD) is classed as UKMEC 2\nin patients who suffer from migraine with aura.\nAt present, there is no evidence that the use of progestogen-only contraception is\nassociated with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke however progestogen-only pill\n(POP), progestogen-only injectables such as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate\n(DMPA) and progestogen-only implant (IMP) are still classed as UKMEC 2 in patients\nwho suffer from migraine with aura. This means that their advantages of use generally\noutweigh the theoretical or proven risks.\nThe only completely safe mode of contraception (excluding barrier methods) is the\ncopper intrauterine device which is classed as UKMEC 1.",

  "explanation": "If you were to see burn marks on finger tips in any given question, think of a loss of\nsensation of temperature and pain in the hands. This is commonly seen in\nsyringomyelia and syringobulbia.\nThe wasted and weak hands with diminished reflexes and weak spastic legs with\ndissociated sensory loss are features suggestive of syringomyelia.\nSyringomyelia and Syringobulbia\nSyringomyelia is a rare condition in which there is fluid-filled tubular cyst (syrinx) within\nthe central, usually cervical, spinal cord. The syrinx can elongate, enlarge and expand\ninto the grey and white matter and, as it does so, it compresses the nervous tissue of\nthe corticospinal and spinothalamic tracts and the anterior horn cells. This leads to\nvarious neurological symptoms and signs, including pain, paralysis, stiffness and\nweakness in the back, shoulders and extremities. Syringomyelia may also cause loss\nof extreme temperature sensation, particularly in the hands, and a cape-like loss of pain\nand temperature sensation along the back and arms.\nSyringobulbia occurs when the syrinx extends into the brainstem. This may affect one\nor more cranial nerves, resulting in facial palsies. Sensory and motor nerve pathways\nmay be affected by interruption and/or compression of nerves.\nNote: Progression of symptoms and deterioration occur over many years for\nsyringomyelia and syringobulbia\nSymptoms of both Syringomyelia and Syringobulbia\n• Damage to the spinal cord often leads to progressive weakness in the arms and\nlegs, stiffness in the back, shoulders, arms, or legs, and chronic, severe pain. These\ncan be present at presentation.\n• Other symptoms may include headaches, a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot\nor cold (especially in the hands), and loss of bladder and other functions.\n• Pain and temperature sensation are lost due to spinothalamic tract damage.\n• Classically, the sensation loss is experienced in a shawl-like distribution over the\narms, shoulders and upper body.\n• Dysaesthesia (pain experienced when the skin is touched) is common.\n• Light touch, vibration and position senses in the feet are affected as the syrinx\nenlarges into the dorsal columns.\n• Muscle wasting and weakness begins in the hands and then affects the forearms\nand shoulders.\n• Tendon reflexes are lost.",

When both halves of the body (right and left) are involved, it is\nclassified as generalised.\nIn this case, this patient’s seizure activity is due to alcohol abuse and therefore should\nfollow guidelines on management related to seizures secondary to alcoholism. Stiffness\nis the tonic phase followed by twitching which is the clonic phase.\nMyoclonic seizures are irregular jerks of the trunk or limbs which occur while the patient\nis conscious and lasts for less than a second. Most of us have this experience when we\nare falling asleep and suddenly jerk as if we fell down from a building. That is\nconsidered a normal phenomenon. Myoclonic seizures in an awake state are not\nnormal and require specialist assessment.",

They are also more commonly seen in\npregnant women and often worsens as pregnancy progresses. The symptoms are\nrelieved by moving.\nUseful advice includes avoiding alcohol, smoking and caffeine. Exercise and good\nsleep hygiene have been shown to benefit symptoms.\nIt is common to measure serum ferritin levels in people suffering from restless legs\nsyndrome as resless legs syndrome is associated with iron deficiency hence the reason\nthe values were given in this stem. If ferritin is low, start iron supplementation, despite\nnormal haemoglobin levels. Since in this question ferritin levels are within normal limits,\nshe would not require iron supplementation.\nOnly around 20% of sufferers would actually need a drug treatment.\nCommon medication used for treatment of restless leg syndrome include:\n• Dopamine agonist\n• Gabapentin\n• Pregabalin",

Non-epileptic attacks may look like epileptic\nseizures but they are not caused by an electrical disturbance in the brain. From the\nhistory given, this sounds more like a non-epileptc attack disorder. The key phrases\nhere that point towards the diagnosis of NEAD is the pelvic movements, episodes\nwehre eyes are closed, no droolingof saliva which means the mouth is closed during the\nattacks and lastly no incontinence.\nVideo electroencephalogram (EEG) is an investigation especially useful to diagnose\nNEAD or if the diagnosis was uncertain. This involves hooking up EEG equipment and\nalso having a continuous video of the patient to capture the activity of the brain and\nphysical movements and sounds during seizures.",

This was\ndone in this question which showed an ischaemic stroke. The next step is to start\nthrombolytics.\nThe other options are less likely to be the appropriate next course of action.\nAnticoagulation → anticoagulants should not be started until brain imaging has\nexcluded haemorrhage, and usually not until 14 days have passed from the onset of an\nischaemic stroke”\nStreptokinase → NHS prefers alteplase over streptokinase.\nStatins → Statins need to be offered but this is not the most appropriate next course of\naction. There is no urgency in giving statins.\nReview in 24 hours → Thrombolysis should only be given if it is administered within\n4.5 hours of onset of stroke symptoms and haemorrhagic stroke has been excluded by\nimaging. So review in 24 hours is clearly a wrong option.\nStroke management\nSummary of management of acute stroke:\n• blood glucose, hydration, oxygen saturation and temperature should be maintained\nwithin normal limits\n• aspirin 300mg orally or rectally should be given as soon as possible if a haemorrhagic\nstroke has been excluded\n• Thrombolysis should only be given if it is administered within 4.5 hours of onset of\nstroke symptoms and haemorrhagic stroke has been excluded by imaging (Alteplase is\ncurrently recommended by NICE)\nPost management stroke\n• Aspirin 300 mg daily for 2 weeks is given immediately after an ischaemic stroke is\nconfirmed by brain imaging.\n• Clopidogrel 75 mg daily is then given long-term\n• If clopidogrel is contraindicated or not tolerated, give a combination of modified-\nrelease dipyridamole and low dose aspirin.\n• Ensure a statin has been offered.",

  "explanation": "The correct answer is Option D. Dementia. This gentleman likely had some cognitive\nimpairment when his wife was alive. She likely helped him with his day to day activities.\nTherefore the problems likely did not surface. Now that he has no support, his\nimpairments have likely worsened and he has not been able to manage alone.\nOrientation to time is usually lost first typically in dementia, followed by orientation to\nplace and finally to person when it is most severe. There are various differences in\npresentation depending on the type of dementia. Another feature that is more\nsuggestive of diagnosis of dementia is the patient’s age. Rememebr that as age\nincreases after the age of 65 years, the incidence of dementia increases exponentially.\nFurthermore, in certain types of dementia hallucinations can be present.\nOption A. Grief reaction is incorrect as this is normally something that lasts for 6\nmonths. In this case, the patient has had memory troubles for more than this time\nframe.\nOption B. Depression is incorrect. There is no mention of low mood in this case or\nhistory of low energy or anhedonia. For a diagnosis of depression there must be at\nleast two of these three core symptoms.\nOption C. Paraphrenia is incorrect. This is an extremely rare type of schizophrenia that\npresents in old age. Given the rareness of this kind of condition, it is highly unlikely to\nbe the answer given the more common conditions as options. Furthermore, one would\nexpect a more acute presentation with likely more florid psychotic features.\nOption E. Hypothyroidism is incorrect. Although this is an important physical diagnosis\nthat is relevant before making a diagnosis of dementia, there are no features in the\nquestion that hint more towards a diagnosis of thyroid disorder.

Almost all patients with\nmyasthenia gravis will have ocular manifestations at some point during the course of\ntheir disease. The most important feature is that muscles fatigue more readily after\nexercise. Antibodies to acetylcholine receptors are seen in 85-90% of cases hence the\nanswer is serum skeletal muscle nicotininc acetylcholine receptor antibody.\nTensilon test is not routinely done any longer.\nMYASTHENIA GRAVIS\nPresentation:\n• Female (20-30 years) ; males (50-60 years)\n• Painless muscle weakness that increases with exercise (This feature of fatigue often\ngives the diagnosis in the exam) - It is even seen in the voice. For example, getting the\npatient to count up to 50. As the patient nears 50 their voice becomes less audible as\nthey are fatiguing.\n• Ocular muscles involved - drooping eyelids\n• Dysphagia, dysarthria, dysphonia\n• Normal reflexes\n• Associated with hyperthyroidism\nA useful mnemonic to remember for clinical features of myasthenia gravis is “D”.\n• Diplopia\n• Drooping eyelids\n• Dysphagia\n• Dysarthria\n• Dysphonia",

Although lumbosacral disc herniation and\ndegenerative process of the spine are causes of cauda equina syndrome it would be\nmore accurate to put Cauda Equina Syndrome as the answer due to the perineal\nsensory loss.\nCauda Equina Syndrome is a serious neurologic condition in which damage to the\ncauda equina causes loss of function of the nerve roots of the spinal canal below the\ntermination (conus medullaris) of the spinal cord. Any lesion which compresses or\ndisturbs the function of the cauda equina may disable the nerves although the most\ncommon is a central disc prolapse.\nSpinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome are neurological emergencies that\nrequire immediate referral and intervention.\nThe management of true cauda equina syndrome frequently involves surgical\ndecompression.\nIf there are red flag signs such as the possibility of cauda equina syndrome like in this\ncase, referral to an orthopaedic surgeon or a neurosurgeon should be considered.\nRed flags that suggest cauda equina syndrome include:\n• Severe or progressive bilateral neurological deficit of the legs, such as major motor\nweakness with knee extension, ankle eversion, or foot dorsiflexion\n• Recent-onset urinary retention and/or urinary incontinence (caused by loss of\nsensation when passing urine).\n• Recent-onset faecal incontinence (due to loss of sensation of rectal fullness)\n• Perianal or perineal sensory loss (saddle anaesthesia or paraesthesia)",

  "explanation": "Plaques can develop anywhere in the central nervous system in patientswith multiple\nsclerosis, but when they develop in the brain stem, a number of functions can be\nimpaired and may result in an evolving vestibular syndrome. Vertigo is often seen with\ndiplopia due to the demyelination of cranial nerves III, IV and VI as they leave the\nbrainstem in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis. Cranial nerves V (trigeminal), VII\n(facial) and VIII (vestibulocochlear) are also seen affected here, seen as having\nsymptoms of trigeminal neuralgia, facial numbness and diffculty hearing (usually a\nsensorineural hearing loss) which again points towards a brainstem involvement.\nThe choice of the cerebellum is incorrect. Lesions to the cerebellum often cause\ncerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, and dysdiadochokinesia.\nThe cerebrum houses many brain structures including the cerebral hemispheres.\nInvovlement of cerebral hemisphere usually involves poor memory and dementia.\nWithout further information, it would be incorrect to choose this as an answer.\nDemyelination in the spinal cord in patients with multiple sclerosis often presents with\nsymmetrical tingling in both upper limbs especially if there is involvement high in the\ndorsal column.

  "choice_d": "Pseudodementia",
  "choice_e": "Vascular dementia",
  "answer": "Pseudodementia",
  "explanation": "Pseudodementia is synonymously referred to as depressive dementia.\nThe history of disturbance in pseudodementia is often short and abrupt in onset, while\ndementia is more often gradual in onset.\nNormal grief respoinse is a common mistake that many would pick. Although we are\ninclined to use time to distinguish pseudodementia and a normal grief response\n(whereby if less than 6 months history of symptoms, we would consider it to be a normal\ngrief response), we ought to be looking at the actual symptoms instead of the time\nframe. Grief response is difficult to define according to time as everyone responds to\ngrief differently.\nRemember, typical normal grief reactions can last up to 12 months with the mean at 6\nmonths.\nIn this question, there are evidences of a relatively abrupt onset, poor memory and a\nhistory of depression. These evidences should help you mark pseudodementia as the\nanswer.\nSuspect pseudodementia in older people with predominantly cognitive symptoms such\nas loss of memory, vagueness, prominent slowing of movement and reduced or slowed\nspeech with a relatively acute onset in whom a major life event has occurred as they are\nmore likely to be suffering from a major depressive episode as opposed to a true\ndementia.\nCOMPARING DEMENTIA, PSEUDODEMENTIA AND GRIEF RESPONSE\nDementia Pseudodementia Grief response\nRecognition Decline in memory and cognitive Severe depression that presents Hard to define as\nfunction sufficient to disrupt daily with poor memory and everyone is\nlife activities in an alert non- concentration and impaired different\ndelirious person functional capacity\nFollows a tragic\nSeen in elderly patients whereby even (loss of a\nthey exhibit symptoms consistent loved one)\nwith dementia but the cause is\nactually depression\nFeatures Gradual onset Onset relatively abrupt Goes through\nstages of grief\nRarely reversible Poor memory\nAngry, guilt,\nIf asked questions, would give Often with past history of disbelief, tearful,\nwrong answers (This is because depression difficulty sleeping\ntrue dementia has poor attention\nand concentration) Often short Symptoms reduce\nin intensity with\nIf asked questions, would reply as acceptance of\n“I don’t know, I can’t be bothered, lsos and\nit’s too difficult” (This is because readjustment\nthey are often upset but their\nattention and concentration are\noften intact)\nResponse to antidepressant\nmedication\nIn reality, in the geriatric age group, it is often difficult to distinguish depression\nand dementia as often they co-exist together. More than 20% of people with\nearly dementia are also depressed.",

  "question": "A 38 year old male presented to Accident and Emergency with the complaint of\nbilateral lower limb weakness. He said that he first noticed this two days ago\nwhen he fumbled while walking down the stairs. He has been noticing a gradual\nincrease in muscle weakness of his legs and he is now unable to walk at all. The\npatient mentions an episode of diarrhoea that began one week ago and that\nlasted approximately two days. He works as a shop assistant and reports no\nproblems at home or at work. The patient was subsequently admitted to the\nmedical ward and physical examination of his limbs revealed a loss of deep\ntendon reflexes. His bilateral leg paralysis has now ascended to affect both of his\nupper limbs as well. What is the SINGLE most likely mechanism causing this\npatient’s problems?",
  "choice_a": "Injury of the corticospinal tract",

  "choice_c": "Demyelination of the peripheral nerve sheath",
  "choice_d": "Infiltration of neurons by amyloid",
  "choice_e": "Mononeuropathy",
  "answer": "Demyelination of the peripheral nerve sheath",
  "explanation": "The patient has Guillain-Barre syndrome. Clues that allude to this diagnosis include his\nsymptoms of ascending limb weakness accompanied by hyporeflexia as well as his\nhistory of a recent illness.\nGuilllain-Barre syndrome is a disorder whereby antibodies created by the body to attack\ninfectious organisms (usually of the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract) also attack\nantigens in the peripheral nerve tissue. The major complaint in most patients is\nweakness or neuropathic pain. Management includes a combination of plasma\nexchange, intravenous immunoglobulin and intubation and ventilation (if the paralysis\nreaches the respiratory muscles)\nInjury of the corticospinal tract is a sensible answer since the corticospinal tract controls\nmovements of the limbs and trunk however the ascending pattern of progressive\nsymmetrical weakness, starting in the lower extremities fits more in line with Guillain-\nBarre syndrome.\nNeuromuscular blockade is used in conjunction with anaesthesia to produce paralysis\nfor surgery. Neuromuscular blockage can be presynaptic (such as botulinum toxin and\ntetanus toxin) or postsynaptic (such as drugs that have clinical importance). This is the\nincorrect answer since this patient is experiencing a gradual ascending paralysis, not an\nimmediate global paralysis.\nDiseases caused by infiltration of amyloids into neurons include Alzheimer’s disease,\nParkinson’s disese, Huntington’s disease and many others. This is therefore the\nincorrect answer.",

However,\nthe stem provides another clue to the diagnosis: the CT findings which are indicative of\nan extradural haemorrhage. Take note of the revised NICE guidelines regarding the\nmanagement of traumatic brain injuries. In this case, this patient not only has raised\nintracranial pressure but he is also showing signs of neurological deficit (unequal pupils)\nin addition to the low Glasgow Score. Therefore, he is not suitable for conservative\nmanagement and requires immediate craniotomy for evacuation of the haematoma.\nExtradural haemorrhage\nPresentation:\n• Trauma to the head\n• Followed by immediate loss of consciousness, +/- lucid interval with decline in mental\nfunction\nDiagnosis:\n• CT head and neck\nTreatment:\n• ABCDE protocol\n• CT head and neck\n• Immediate craniotomy\n• If GCS > 8 + other CT criteria met, may attempt for conservative management →\nobservation and serial CT brain",

  "answer": "Compression of the ipsilateral sympathetic chain",
  "explanation": "This man is suffering from Horner’s syndrome secondary to the Pancoast tumour.\nHorner’s syndrome describes an ipsilateral deficiency of sympathetic activity. There are\nmany causes of a Horner’s syndrome, but the one that is tested the most in exams is a\nPancoast tumour.\nPancoast tumours are located at the apex of the lung and may compress the\nsympathetic ganglion resulting in symptoms of Horner’s syndrome.\nAlthough sympathetic chain involvement is technically correct, this answer is vague and\ncould refer to bilateral sympathetic chain involvement. Compression of the ipsilateral\nsympathetic chain is a better answer as a descriptor of the underlying mechanism.\nThe cause of Horner’s syndrome is an interruption of sympathetic pathways and not an\nirritation of the pathways.\nUnderactivity, and not overactivity, is the cause of Horner’s syndrome.\nAlthough involvement of the hypothalamospinal tract is a known cause of Horner’s\nsyndrome, it is not correct in this case because involvement of the hypothalamospinal\ntract occurs in spinal cord lesions. The reason for the symptoms of Horner’s syndrome,\nin this case, has been given as a Pancoast tumour.",

In such cases, there is no need for a systemic treatment as topical treatment\ncan alleviate symptoms.\nCurrent evidence suggests that, the use of HRT is nto associated with an increase in\nblood pressure and therefore HRT is not contraindicated in women with hypertension as\nlong as the blood pressure can be controlled by antihypertensive medication. It is good\npractice to monitor the patient’s blood pressure 2 to 3 times in the first 6 months and\nthen 6 monthly.\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) indications\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) involves the use of a small dose of\noestrogen,combined with a progestogen (in women with a uterus), to help alleviate\nmenopausalsymptoms.\nCurrent indications for the use of HRT are:\n• Vasomotor symptoms such as flushing, including sleep, mood disturbance and\nheadaches\n• For women with early menopause. They should be treated with HRT until the age of\nnatural menopause (around 51 years). The most important reason for HRT in this\ngroup is preventing the development of osteoporosis\n• For those women under 60 years who are at risk of an osteoporotic fracture in\nwhom non-oestrogen treatments are unsuitable\nIt is especially important to note that other indications such as reversal of vaginal\natrophy should be treated with topical oestrogens.",

  "answer": "Urge incontinence",
  "explanation": "This is the common presentation of urge incontinence. See below for the description\nofthe types of urinary incontinence:\nUrge incontinence / overactive bladder (OAB) → is due to detrusor over\nactivity.Common complaint is “when I have to go to the toilet, I really have to go” or “I\nhave thedesire to pass urine and sometimes urine leaks before I have time to get to the\ntoilet”\nStress incontinence → leaking small amounts of urine when coughing or\nlaughing.Usually with a history of many vaginal deliveries as this would weaken the\npelvic floormuscles.\nMixed incontinence → a mix of both urge and stress incontinence\nOverflow incontinence → involuntary release of urine from an overfull urinarybladder,\noften in the absence of any urge to urinate. Occurs in people who have ablockage of the\nbladder outlet (benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, ornarrowing of the\nurethra), or when the muscle that expels urine from the bladder istoo weak to empty the\nbladder normally.\nUrethrovaginal fistula → Opening between vagina and urethra. Common complaint is“\nthere is continual leakage of urine from my vagina” or “my vagina has a foul smell”.\nMANAGEMENT OF URINARY INCONTINENCE\nThe management of incontinence depends on whether urge or stress urinary\nincontinence is predominant.\nFor stress incontinence:\n1. Pelvic floor exercise is the initial treatment of choice. NICE recommends that at\nleast eight contractions are performed three times a day for a minimum of three\nmonths.\n2. Surgical procedures e.g., retropubic mid-urethral tape procedures may be required.\n3. Duloxetine is used for those who are not surgical candidates.\nFor urge incontinence\n1. Bladder retraining (minimum of six weeks). The idea is to gradually increase the\nintervals between voiding\n2. Bladder stabilising drugs: antimuscarinic agents are first-line. NICE recommends\noxybutynin, tolterodine or darifenacin. Immediate release oxybutynin should,\nhowever, be avoided in frail older women.",

  "question": "A 33 year old woman who is rhesus negative had just delivered vaginally 3 hours\nago. She would like to know when is the best time for anti-D immunoglobulins to\nbe administered. What is the recommended time to administer anti-D\nimmunoglobulins to a previously non-sensitised rhesus negative mother after\ndelivery?",
  "choice_a": "As soon as possible and always within 24 hours",
  "choice_b": "Anytime in the time frame of 48 hours",
  "choice_c": "As soon as possible and always within 72 hours",
  "choice_d": "Up to 10 days",
  "choice_e": "After 24 hours",
  "answer": "As soon as possible and always within 72 hours",
  "explanation": "Following potentially sensitising events which include giving birth, anti-D\nimmunoglobulins should be administered as soon as possible and always within 72\nhours of the sensitising event. If exceptionally this deadline has not been met and 72\nhours have passed, you can still administer anti-D immunoglobulins up to 10 days as\nthere may still be some protection offered during this time.\nRHESUS NEGATIVE PREGNANCY\nA basic understanding of the pathophysiology is essential to understand\nRhesusnegative pregnancies.\nIf a Rh -ve mother delivers a Rh +ve child a leak of fetal red blood cells may occur\nwhich causes anti-D IgG antibodies to form in mother. In future pregnancies these\nantibodiescan cross placenta and cause haemolysis in fetus.\nPrevention of Rh sensitization\n• Test for anti-D antibodies in all Rh -ve mothers at booking\n• If Rh –ve and not previously sensitised, NICE (2008) advise giving anti-D at 28 and 34\nweeks gestation\n• anti-D is for prophylaxis only–Remember once sensitization has occurred it is\nirreversible and Anti-D administration would be pointless\nAnti-rhesus (anti-D) immunoglobulin are given intramuscularly. It neutralises any\nRhesus D positive antigens which have entered mother’s blood. If the antigens have\nbeen neutralized, there will be no reason for mother to develop an immunity and\nproduce antibodies. She would remain non-sensitised.\nAnti-D immunoglobulin should be given as soon as possible (but always within\n72hours) in the following situations:\n• delivery of a Rh +ve infant, whether live or stillborn\n• any termination of pregnancy or evacuation of retained products of conception (ERPC)\nafter miscarriage\n• miscarriage if gestation is > 12 weeks\n• ectopic pregnancy\n• blunt abdominal trauma\n• external cephalic version\n• antepartum haemorrhage, any vaginal bleeding over 12 weeks gestation\n• amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, fetal blood sampling\nAffected fetus\n• If unborn\no Oedematous (hydrops fetalis, as liver devoted to RBC production thus albumin\nfalls)\no Foetal heart failure\no Treatment involves intrauterine blood transfusion\n• If born\no Jaundice (due to build up of excessive bilirubin from RBC breakdown)\no Anaemia\no Hepatosplenomegaly\n• Treatment involvesUV phototherapy, blood transfusion, exchange transfusion",

  "question": "A 45 year old lady comes to the family planning clinic for contraception advice.\nShe has two young children and does not want anymore children. An incidental\nfinding of multiple small submucosal fibroids was found recently on an\nultrasound scan. She is asymptomatic and her medical history is otherwise\ninsignificant. What is SINGLE most appropriate contraceptive for this lady?",
  "choice_a": "Etonogestrel",
  "choice_b": "Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP)",
  "choice_c": "Progestogen-only pill (POP)",
  "choice_d": "Intrauterine system (IUS)",
  "choice_e": "Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD)",
  "answer": "Intrauterine system (IUS)",
  "explanation": "Combined hormonal contraception (CHC): despite the 'pill' previously being considereda\nrisk factor for fibroid growth, CHC is helpful if the patient requires\ncontraception,although it is not as effective as a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine\nsystem. Thus,intrauterine system would be the answer here.\nIntrauterine system (IUS) reduces the uterine size in women with fibroids.\nIf this lady here had presented with asymptomatic fibroids and was not looking\nforcontraception, expectant management would be a valid answer especially if she\nwasperi-menopausal.\nCONTRACEPTION CLINCHERS\nChoosing the correct contraceptive for the correct situation is something a lot of doctors\nhave problems with. Here are some useful contraception/abnormal uterine bleeding\nclinchers for the exam.\nYoung woman, not sexually active (don’t require contraception)\n• Menorrhagia only – Tranexamic acid\n• Menorrhagia with dysmenorrhoea – Mefenamic acid\n• Menorrhagia/dysmenorrhoea/metrorrhagia (irregular menses) - COCP\nSexually active woman (require contraception)\n• Menorrhagia/dysmenorrhoea or those suffering from fibroids (which do not distort\nthe uterine cavity) – IUS Mirena (first-line). These questions will also mention\npossible contraindications for COCP like obesity/smoking/history of\nthromboembolism etc.\nNote: If women are younger than 20 years old, IUS Mirena is not first line as it is\nconsidered to be UKMEC 2, thus if no contraindications, COCP, POP or implant\nmay be more suitable as they would be UKMEC 1.\n• Women with sickle cell disease and menorrhagia – Depo-provera IM\nEmergency contraception\n• Within 72 hours of unprotected sex – Levonelle pill\n• Within 120 hours of unprotected sex – IUCD or ellaOne pill\nFIBROID MANAGEMENT\nIf asymptomatic\n• Follow up annually to monitor size and growth unless rapid growth or reason to\nsuspect pelvic malignancy in which case further investigations are warranted\nWith menorrhagia\n• Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) – provided uterine fibroid is\nnot distorting uterine cavity\n• Tranexamic acid, NSAIDs or COCP\n• Norethisterone as a temporary measure\nWith severe menorrhagia and fibroid more than 3 cm\n• Ulipristal acetate up to 4 courses\no Each course is up to 3 months\no Usually used in pre-operative treatment\nSurgical management\n• Hysterectomy – The most successful treatment\n• Myomectomy\n• Uterine artery embolization\n• Endometrial ablation – only for fibroids less than 3 cm in diameter\nBoth myomectomy and uterine artery embolization can be performed in patients who\nwould like to preserve their fertility with myomectomy usually being the preferred option\nin these cases especially if treatment of infertility is required. Myomectomy has been\nshown to increase pregnancy rates compared with uterine artery embolization.\nOther medical managements\n• Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists\no Reduces the size of fibroids and are used prior to surgery to reduce\nperioperative blood loss\no Surgery must take place as uterine fibroids would return to pretreatment size if\nGnRH agonist treatment is stopped",

She has regular 28 day cycles. She also suffers from menorrhagia.\nShe has had a laparoscopic tubal sterilisation in the past. She takes ibuprofen\nand paracetamol for pain relief during the first few days of pelvic pain. She is\ncurrently sexually active with her stable partner of 10 years. She has no bowel or\nurinary symptoms. Endometriosis is suspected. What is the SINGLE most\nappropriate action?",

  "choice_c": "Request a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging",
  "choice_d": "Prescribe antibiotics",
  "choice_e": "Arrange a diagnostic laparoscopy",
  "answer": "Prescribe a trial of combined oral contraceptive pill",
  "explanation": "The key to answer this is knowing when a diagnostic laparoscopy is required for\nendometriosis. In practice, we would offer a trial of hormonal treatment for a period of 3\nto 6 months before having a diagnostic laparoscopy. This is due to the risk of\nlaparoscopic surgery with the additional fact that even with a laparoscopic ablation of\nendometrial tissue the relapse of symptoms occurs in 40 to 45% of women with up to\n30% of women being readmitted for surgery within 5 years.\nENDOMETRIOSIS\nEndometriosis is the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity. It\nisoestrogen dependent, and therefore mostly affects women during their\nreproductiveyears. If the ectopic endometrial tissue is within the myometrium itself it is\ncalledadenomyosis.\nUp to 10-12% of women have a degree of endometriosis\nClinical features\n• Chronic pelvic pain (cyclic or constant)\n• Dysmenorrhoea - pain often starts days before bleeding\n• Deep dyspareunia (indicates possible involvement of uterosacral ligaments)\n• Subfertility\nInvestigation\n• Laparoscopy is the gold-standard investigation\n• Transvaginal ultrasound scanning appears to be a useful test, both to make andto\nexclude the diagnosis of an ovarian endometrioma\nManagement\n• NSAIDs to treat pain\n• Combined oral contraceptive pill (other hormonal drugs can be used too)\n• Levonorgestrel intrauterine system\nNote: Drug therapy unfortunately does not seem to have a significant impact onfertility\nrates\nSurgery\nLaparoscopic excision and ablation of endometrioid lesions helps reduceendometriosis-\nassociated pain.

  "explanation": "There are actually two possibilities here. Endometriosis and pelvic congestion\nsyndrome. Given that endometriosis is much more common than pelvic congestion\nsyndrome, endometriosis is the answer.\nA take home point here is a normal ultrasound pelvis does not exclude endometriosis.\nEndometriosis presents exactly the way they describe in this question with chronic\npelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia. Pelvic ultrasound scans are usually\nnormal.\nIn pelvic venous congestion there are dilated veins believed to cause a cyclical dragging\npain. It is worse premenstrually and after prolonged periods of standing and walking.\nDyspareunia is also often present.\nGiven there is no history of standing here, pick endometriosis.

  "explanation": "No action needed. Latest recommendations are that no additional contraceptive\nprecautions are required when combined oral contraceptives are used with\nantibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes, unless diarrhoea or vomiting occur.\nORAL CONTRACEPTION INTERACTION AND HEPATIC ENZYME INDUCERS\nHepatic enzyme inducers can decrese the effectiveness of the combined oral\ncontraceptive pill and progesterone only pill when taken at normal doses. The two most\ncommonly askd oral contraception interactions with hepatic enzyme inducers are:\n1. Rifampicin\n2. Anticonvulsants (such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitone)\nWomen starting enzyme-inducing drugs should be advised to use a reliable\ncontraceptive method which is unaffected by enzyme inducers.\nIn general, depo-provera, copper intrauterine devices or the levonorgestrel containing\nintrauterine system (LNG-IUS) are the safest to use.\nOnce stopping hepatic enzyme inducers, women are still advised to continue\nappropriate contraceptive measures for another 4 to 8 weeks as enzyme activity does\nnot return to normal until several weeks of stopping hepatic inducers.\nA disrespectful but good mnemonic to remember for enzyme inducers is: CRAP GPs.\nWhilst majority of GPs are absolutely fantastic, if a GP prescribes rifampicin and\ncombined oral contraceptive pill without informing the woman of contraception failure,\nhe may be called a Crap GP. A good GP would discuss the use of additional barrier\nmethods, having progesterone only injections, insertion of intrauterine devices or use of\nincreasing dose of oestrogen.\nCarbamazepine\nRifampicin\nAlcohol – chronic consumption\nPhenytoin\nGriseofulvin\nPhenobarbitone\nSulfonylureas",

On vaginal examination, cervical excitation\nwas noted and she is tender on both adnexae. She has no significant past\nmedical history. Which is the SINGLE most likely cause of her symptoms?",

  "choice_b": "Endometriosis",
  "choice_c": "Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome",
  "choice_d": "Cervicitis",
  "choice_e": "Asherman syndrome",
  "answer": "Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)",
  "explanation": "Multiple sexual partners are a risk factor for pelvic inflammatory disease. Women ofher\nage group (<25 years old) are of greater risk for pelvic inflammatory disease as theyare\nmore sexually active during this period.\nOther options are less likely because:\nEndometriosis → Although chronic pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia and\nmenstrualirregularities could be seen in endometriosis. It is unlikely the given choice\nhere as thehistory of multiple sexual partners and cervical excitation do not match with\nthisanswer. This pain is non cyclical which also suggests PID rather than\nendometriosis.\nFitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome → is a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease\n(PID).Usually presents with an acute onset of right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal\npainaggravated by breathing, or coughing. This pain may be referred to the right\nshoulder\nCervicitis → Presents with discharge. Do not get confused between cervicitis and\nPID.Infection at the cervix can eventually ascend to cause PID. But if the infection is\npurelyat the cervix, they will not present with menstrual irregularities and lower\nabdominalpain as the infection has not ascended to involve the uterus, fallopian tubes,\nandovaries.\nAsherman syndrome → are adhesions of the endometrium often associated\nwithdilation and curettage of the intrauterine cavity. It results in infertility. Often,\ntheyexperience menstrual irregularities. But in this question there is no relevant\npastmedical history meaning she did not have any dilation and curettage thus this\noption isvery unlikely.\nPELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE (PID)\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a term used to describe infection and\ninflammationof the female pelvic organs including the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries\nand thesurrounding peritoneum. Most commonly caused by ascending infection from\ntheendocervix.\nCausative organisms\n• Chlamydia trachomatis - the most common cause\n• Neisseria gonorrhoeae\nRisk factors for PID\n• Age <25\n• Previous STIs\n• New sexual partner/multiple sexual partners\n• Uterine instrumentation such as surgical termination of pregnancy\n• Intrauterine contraceptive devices\n• Post-partum endometritis\nFeatures\n• lower abdominal pain\n• fever\n• deep dyspareunia\n• dysuria and menstrual irregularities may occur\n• vaginal or cervical discharge\n• cervical excitation\n• Abnormal vaginal bleeding (intermenstrual, postcoital)\nInvestigation\n• screen for Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea\nManagement\nThere are many combinations of antibiotics to treat PID. It is unlikely that thePLAB test\nwould ask you the management of PID. PLAB questions may ask youfor the\nmanagement of cervicitis (but unlikely PID). Remember, cervicitis is notthe same as\nPID.\nThis is one of the combination examples for treatment of PID:\nOutpatients: Ceftriaxone 500 mg as a single intramuscular dose, followed by\noraldoxycycline 100 mg twice daily plus oral metronidazole 400 mg twice daily, both for\n14days.\nNote the differences between acute PID and just cervicitis.\nIf just cervicitis (Chlamydia)\n• Azithromycin 1g single dose (OR doxycycline 100mg bd for 7 days) (both havesimilar\nefficacy of more than 95%)\nIf just cervicitis (Neisseria gonorrhoeae)\n• Azithromycin 1g PO and ceftriaxone 500mg IM\nRCOG guidelines suggest that in mild cases of PID intrauterine contraceptivedevices\nmay be left in. The more recent BASHH guidelines suggest that theevidence is limited\nbut that ' Removal of the IUD should be considered andmay be associated with better\nshort term clinical outcomes'\nComplications\n• infertility - the risk may be as high as 10-20% after a single episode\n• chronic pelvic pain\n• ectopic pregnancy",

  "choice_d": "Hyperemesis gravidarum",
  "choice_e": "Molar pregnancy",
  "answer": "Molar pregnancy",
  "explanation": "Not all questions are straightforward in exams. You will come across some where you\nwould feel information is missing like this one. The options of incorrect dates and molar\npregnancy come close.\nIt is important to that that the question states the uterus extends up to 16 weeks\ngestation. It can therefore be inferred that the pregnancy is either large for dates with a\nuterine fibroid or molar pregnancy alernatively an incorrect menstrual period date is also\na possibility.\nIf this patient had uterine fibroids, it would NOT explain the excessive morning sickness.\nIf this patient had an incorrect menstrual period date and was actually 16 weeks\ngestation, it would NOT explain the reason hyperemesis started so late in pregnancy.\nSymptoms of hyperemesis would have occurred several weeks ago as hyperemesis\nsymptoms begin 6 to 8 weeks and peaks at 12 weeks.\nThe patient is presenting with features of molar pregnancy which are uterus large for\ndates, first trimester bleeding, and hyperemesis. This is a presentation that is also\nsimilar to multiple pregnancies like twin pregnancy as they are also at increased risk of\nbleeding, hyperemesis and have a uterus that is larger for dates. However, in multiple\npregnancies the urterus is seen to be larger in the second trimester rather than the first.\nAlso, multiple pregnancies is not an option given here.\nHyperemesis gravidarum is not completely incorrect as this patient also has a diagnosis\nof hyperemesis gravidarum as she is seen to be vomiting for the past two weeks.\nHowever, the most likely diagnosis given the whole clinical picture is still molar\npregnancy.\nGestational Trophoblastic Disease\nGestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) covers a spectrum of diseases caused\nbyovergrowth of the placenta. It ranges from molar pregnancies to malignant\nconditionssuch as choriocarcinoma. If there is any evidence of persistence of GTD the\ncondition isreferred to as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).\nGTD is classified as follows:\nPremalignant - hydatidiform mole\n• Complete hydatidiform mole (CHM)\n• Partial hydatidiform mole (PHM)\nMalignant - gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN)\n• Invasive mole\n• Choriocarcinoma\n• Placental site trophoblastic tumour (PSTT)\n• Epithelioid trophoblastic tumour (ETT)\nThe classification of GTD is less in important. An exam of this level usually does not\nrequire you to know details of types of GTD.\nFeatures:\n• Hyperemesis\no Due to excessive amounts of human chorionic gonatotropin (hCG)\n• Irregular first-trimester vaginal bleeding\n• Uterus large for dates\n• Vaginal passage of vesicles containing products of conception\n• Serum hCG is excessively high with complete moles, but levels may be withinthe\nnormal range for partial moles.\nUltrasound findings of a complete mole\n• ‘Snowstorm’ appearance of mixed echogenicity, representing hydropic villi and\nintrauterine haemorrhage\n• Large theca lutein cysts\nManagement of Hydatidiform mole:\n• Surgical evacuation (Suction curettage)\no Note that histological examination of products of conception isessential to confirm\ndiagnosis\n• Two-weekly serum and urine samples until hCG concentrations are normal.\no Women should be advised not to conceive until hCG level has beennormal for 6\nmonths\no Barrier contraception should be used until serum hCG is normal (oral\ncontraception may also be used after molar evactuation, before hCG returns to\nnormal)\nManagement of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN)\nThis is unlikely to be asked in detail in PLAB 1 due to the complexity of\nthemanagement. But you do need to know it involves chemotherapy. If chemotherapy\nis started, women should wait a year from completion of their treatment before trying to\nconceive.",

  "explanation": "This is a typical case of stress incontinence. To understand it further, first we need to\nunderstand what urinary incontinence is. Incontinence is the involuntary leakage of\nurine.\nStress incontinence is a leak of small amounts of urine when coughing or laughing.\nThis is due to an increase in intra-abdominal pressure. Usually with a history of many\nvaginal deliveries as this would weaken the pelvic floor muscles. The next management\nhere would be pelvic floor exercises. Loss of weight and reducing caffeine are other\nlifestyle modifications that could be effective but were not given in this question.",

Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago.\nA pregnancy test done in the GP clinic was positive. She has a transvaginal\nultrasound scan, which is reported as ‘inconclusive’. Serum human chorionic\ngonadotropin (hCG) is 1400 IU/litre. What is the SINGE most likely diagnosis?\n(A serum hCG above 24 IU/litre is considered positive for pregnancy)",

  "choice_b": "Ectopic pregnancy",
  "choice_c": "Complete miscarriage",
  "choice_d": "Threatened miscarriage",
  "choice_e": "Incomplete miscarriage",
  "answer": "Ectopic pregnancy",
  "explanation": "The diagnosis here is ectopic pregnancy. The first clue here is the gestational age →\n8weeks. Ectopic pregnancies would usually present around 6-8 weeks from start of\nlastperiod as it is then that they are large enough to stretch the fallopian tubes\nthuscausing pain. The stretching of the fallopian tubes is also the reason why they\nmaysometimes experience cervical motion tenderness on a vaginal examination.\nThe second clue here is the unilateral abdominal pain. This gives us a clue that\nthepathology is towards one side rather than in the middle.\nThe remaining choices are far less likely to be the correct answer\nFibroids → In the past, fibroids could be the cause of an inconclusive scan as they\nmayobstruct the view of the gestational sac. However, with the modern transvaginal\nscanthis is no longer the case. And thus ectopic pregnancies are a more likely\ndiagnosishere.\nComplete miscarriage - Is when all products of conception has been expelled. This\nisunlikely the case as she has only suffered a mild vaginal bleeding (vaginal spotting).\nThreatened miscarriage → Presents with vaginal bleeding + fetal heart is seen.\nAdiagnosis of threatened miscarriage cannot be made without seeing a viable fetus\nonan ultrasound scan.\nIncomplete miscarriage → Not all products of conception have been expelled.\nThismeans that products of conception would still be visible on an ultrasound scan.\nECTOPIC PREGNANCY\nDefined by the implantation of a fertilized ovum outside the uterus\nClinical features\n• lower abdominal pain: typically the first symptom.\n• vaginal bleeding: usually less than a normal period\n• history of recent amenorrhoea: typically 6-8 weeks from start of last period\n• peritoneal bleeding can cause shoulder tip pain\nAny woman at a childbearing age who attends A&E with abdominal pain MUST have a\nurine pregnancy test performed. Ruptured ectopic pregnancies are life-threatening. Do\nnot miss a diagnosis of an ectopic by forgetting to do a urine pregnancy test.\nExamination findings\n• abdominal tenderness\n• cervical excitation (also known as cervical motion tenderness)\n• adnexal mass may be noticed – rarely seen\nAlways observe the blood pressure of the patient as a significant drop of blood pressure\nin a suspected ectopic needs to be quickly escalated\nManagement:\n• If haemodynamically stable → Laparoscopic salpingectomy or salpingostomy\n• If haemodynamically unstable → Laparotomy (open salpingectomy or\nsalpingostomy)\nMethotrexate would be first line for an ectopic pregnancy if the patient was not in\nsignificant pain however it can only be used if it contains all the criteria below\n• Not in significant pain\n• Haemodynamically stable\n• Adnexal mass smaller than 35 mm with no fetal heart visible\n• No intrauterine pregnancy\n• Serum hCG less than 5000 IU/litre (ideally less than 1500 IU/litre)\n• Able to return for follow-up\nIt is unlikely that the examiners for the exam expct you to know these criteria thus\nmethotrexate is unlikely to be the answer in exam",

She states that there have been no problems during her pregnancy\nand that she has been seeing her midwife in the community. On examination, a\nsoft and relaxed uterus is noteed with a fundal height of 32 cm. CTG is normal.\nShe has a pulse of 112 beats/minute, a blood pressure of 94/60 mmHg and a\nrespiratory rate of 26 breaths/minute. What is the SINGLE most likely diagnosis?",

  "choice_b": "Placenta accreta",
  "choice_c": "Placenta praevia",
  "choice_d": "Preterm labor",
  "choice_e": "Vasa praevia",
  "answer": "Placenta praevia",
  "explanation": "Painless vaginal bleeding without abdominal pain should raise suspicion of placenta\npraevia.\nIn the UK, it is common to have an ultrasound scan during the first trimester and again\naround 20 weeks for an anomaly scan which the sonongrapher would formally report\nthe position of the placenta. In this stem, she did not have previous scans and so she\nmay very well have a low lying placenta.\nThe painless bleeding seen in placenta praevia may occur without warning or after\nintercourse. This is one reason obstetricians advise women with placenta praevia not to\nhave intercourse.\nFrom her observations, one can see that it is maternal blood that is being lost which is\nconsistent with placenta praevia. If this was the case of vasa praevia, it would be foetal\nblood that would be lost and maternal observations would remain normal.\nPlacental abruption presents with sudden onset abdominal pain +/- vaginal bleeding. It\nis also commonly associated with CTG abnormalities.\nPlacenta accreta is less common than placenta praevia and are seen commonly in the\npresence of a uterine scar which alows the placenta to attach to the myometrium\nPLACENTA PRAEVIA\nPlacenta praevia describes a placenta lying wholly or partly in the lower\nuterinesegment.This is common early in the pregnancy, but is most often not associated\nwith bleeding.\nThe key clinical feature is painless bleeding after 24 weeks of gestation.\nRisk factors\n• previous placenta praevia\n• multiple pregnancies\nClinical features\n• Painless vaginal bleed\n• uterus not tender\n• lie and presentation may be abnormal\n• fetal heart usually normal\nThe painless late-pregnancy bleeding may occur during rest or activity, suddenlyand\nwithout warning. It may be preceded by trauma, coitus, or pelvic examination. A digital\nvaginal examination should not be performed. However, a speculum or a transvaginal\nprobe can safely be used in placenta praevia.\nDiagnosis\nThis is based on the presence of painless late-trimester vaginal bleeding with\nanobstetric ultrasound showing placental implantation over the lower uterine segment.\nA transvaginal ultrasound is preferred over abdominal ultrasound for detection\nofplacenta praevia.\nIn the UK, most low-lying placentas are detected at the routine anomaly scans (around\n20 weeks gestation). This is done transabdominally. If the placenta extends over the\ninternal cervical os, they are offered another transabdominal scan at 32 weeks. If the\nposition of the placenta is still unclear using a transabdominal scan, a transvaginal scan\nis offered.\nAround 5% will have low-lying placenta when scanned at 16-20 weeks gestation\nhowever the incidence at delivery is only 0.5%, therefore most placentas rise away from\ncervix during the second and third trimester.",

  "question": "A 35 year old woman presented with the complaint of lower abdominal pain to the\ngynaecology outpatient clinic. She had been experiencing mild abdominal pain\nsince the insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) two months\nago. Her last menstrual period was seven days ago. On speculum examination,\nthe IUCD strings were not visualized. The patient says that she is in a long term\nsexual relationship with her boyfriend of three years. The patient was\nsubsequently referred fro a transvaginal ultrasound whereupon the IUCD was not\nfound in the uterus. What is the SINGLE most appropriate next step in this case?",
  "choice_a": "X-ray of the abdomen",
  "choice_b": "Hysteroscopy",
  "choice_c": "Laparoscopy",
  "choice_d": "Emergency contraception",
  "choice_e": "Reassure that the IUD has fallen out",
  "answer": "X-ray of the abdomen",
  "explanation": "To answer this question accurately, it is essential to know about the management of lost\nintrauterine device threads.\nHow do we manage lost intrauterine device threads?\n1. Exclude pregnancy by performing a urine pregnancy test\n2. Request a pelvic ultrasound to look for the IUCD\n3. If the IUCD is not found on ultrasound, request an abdominal X-ray\nEmergency contraceptin is incorrect as there is no evidence of recent sexual\nintercourse in the stem. Remember, one needs to know the timing of sexual intercourse\nto know which emergency contraception to use. Example, levonorgestrel can be used\nfor up to 72 hours whereas ulipristal acetate and copper intrauterine device can be used\nup to 5 days.\nWe are not sure if the coil is in place. There is no evidence of sexual intercourse.\nA hysteroscopy may be used to remove an IUCD from within the uterine cavity provided\nit is proven to be there.\nAn X-ray of the abdomen would be best to determine if the IUCD is in the abdomen.\nThis can occur when the IUCD perforates through the uterus during insertion or finds a\nway to migrate to the abdominal cavity when initially inserted intrauterine. If the IUCD is\nfound outside the uterus but inside the abdominal cavity, a laparoscopy can be done to\nretrieve it.\nMANAGEMENT OF LOST INTRAUTERINE DEVICE THREADS\nThe explanation below is rather specific and most likely not required for PLAB but they\ndo help with the understanding of what do you do in situations where the IUD thread is\nnot found.\nSpeculum examination reveals no IUD thread\n• Take menstrual and sexual history, exclude pregnancy. Provide alternative\ncontraception and/or post coital contraception if indicated by history\n• If woman is pregnant\no Refer to Early Pregnancy Unit for rapid access to ultrasound scan. Viabilty of\npregnancy, site, gestation will need to be determined. The management from\nhere on is rather complex and unlikely to be asked in the PLAB test\n• If woman is not pregnant\no Refer for ultrasound scan. Ensure contraception is given until ultrasound scan\nis performed.\n▪ If ultrasound scan reports misplaced in cavity, the management depends on\nsymptoms and degree of displacement.\n▪ If ultrasound scan reports device is correctly located in the uterus, leave the\nIUD in situ until it is due to be removed.\n▪ If IUD not seen in uterus, order a plain abdominal X-ray\n• If abdo X-ray shows IUD is in the abdominal cavity, this may require\nlaparoscopic removal\n• If abdo X-ray shwos IUD not located, this implies that IUD has fallen out\nand replacement of IUD can be offered.",

  "choice_e": "Reassure, no change of management",
  "answer": "Low molecular weight heparin and aspirin",
  "explanation": "She has been diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome in the past. This puts her at\nrisk for blood clots and she would eventually need heparin. Heparin and aspirin also\nreduces the risk of miscarriages in patients with diagnosed antiphospholipid syndrome.\nNICE guidelines (2015) gives clear recommendations for use of prophylactic cerclage\nand prophylactic vaginal progesterone. They should be offered to women if she has a\nhistory of spontaneous preterm birth or mid-trimester loss between 16 weeks and 34\nweeks of gestation AND in whom a transvaginal ultrasound scan has been carried out\nbetween 16 to 24 weeks of pregnancy that reveals a cervical length of less than 25 mm.\nProphylactic cervical cerclage can also be considered in women with cervical length\nless than 25 mm who have a history of cervical trauma like a LLETZ procedure. This\npatient had 3 early miscarriages and thus there is no indication for a cervical cerclage or\nprogesterone pessaries.\nCERVICAL CERCLAGE\nCervical weakness is a recognised cause of second-trimester miscarriage. The\ndiagnosisis essentially a clinical one and based on a history of second-\ntrimestermiscarriage preceded by spontaneous rupture of membranes or\npainlesscervical dilatation.\nCervical cerclage does come with risks which are related to the surgery. Risks include\ninfections and rupture of the membranes.\nThe criteria is a strict and complicated one thus it is unlikely to bea correct answer\nduring PLAB part 1. Nonetheless, if they do give a history of painlessdilatation during\nthe previous miscarriages, cervical cerclage could be the option.\nANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME\nAntiphospholipid syndrome is the most important treatable cause of\nrecurrentmiscarriage. Antiphospholipid syndrome refers to the association\nbetweenantiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies and\nanti-B2 glycoprotein-I antibodies) and adverse pregnancy outcome or vascular\nthrombosis.\nAll women with recurrent first-trimester miscarriage and all women with one or\nmoresecond-trimester miscarriage should be screened before pregnancy\nforantiphospholipid antibodies. Note the term recurrent miscarriage refers to loss of\nthree or more consecutive pregnancies.\nIf diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome, pregnant women can be treated with\naspirin 75 mg plus heparin as this is seen to lower the risk of further miscarriage.\nCorticosteroids have no role in improving live birth rate of women with recurrent\nmiscarriage associated with antiphospholipid antibodies.",

Norethisterone (15 mg) daily from days 5 to 26 of the menstrual cycle, or injected\nlong-acting progestogens.\nThis should take into account if contraception is desired. If contraception is desired,\nthen preference would go towards intrauterine system (Mirena) followed by COCP and\ninjected long-acting progestogens.\nImportant combinations\n• Combination of tranexamic acid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)\ncan beused if patient has both menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhoea\n• Combination of NSAID and COCP can beused if dysmenorrhoea is problematic\n• Do NOT combine tranexamic acid with a COCP or Mirena coil\nFor heavy menstrual bleeding that needs stopping rapidly:\n• Oral norethisterone 5 mg three times daily for 10 days\nIn secondary care, treatment includes:\n• Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists\nThe management of menorrhagia and fibroids overlap considerably. So it is always\nwise to go through these two topics together.",

  "question": "A 34 year old woman presents to the infertility clinic with her husband. They\nhave been trying to conceive for 3 years but have not been succesful despite\nhaving regular intercourse. Her BMI is 31 kg/m2. She has dark pigmentation on\nher neck and severe acne on her face. She also complains of thinning of her hair.\nShe was sent for an ultrasound scan which showed multiple follicles on both her\novaries. What is the SINGLE most appropriate initial management to treat her\ninfertility?",
  "choice_a": "Weight loss",
  "choice_b": "Clomifene Citrate",
  "choice_c": "Laparoscopic ovarian drilling",
  "choice_d": "Combined oral contraceptive pills",
  "choice_e": "Spironolactone",
  "answer": "Weight loss",
  "explanation": "The question here describes signs and symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome\n(PCOS). The scenario of acne on her face points towards an excess of androgens\n(hirsutism, alopecia, acne are all manifetations of hyperandrogenism). Not to mention\nthat her initial complaint was infertility which is one of the diagnostic criterion for PCOS.\nThe dark pigmentation on her neck is called acanthosis nigricans which is characterised\nby brown to black hyperpigmentation of the skin found in body folds, such as the axilla,\nnape of the neck, and groin. It is a marker of insulin resistance.\nWeight loss is the most appropriate answer as part of the INITIAL management.\nClomifene citrate is an option together with weight loss however it is advisable to\nencourage weight loss first. In practice, we would advise patients to lose weight while\ngetting blood test done to confirm anovulation.\nThere are some clinicians who wouldstart them on metformin right away on their first\nvisit. This is a debatable action but since metformin was not given in the options, we\nshall not discuss it here. Just note that meformin is currently unlicensed for use in\nPCOS andso women would need to be counselled carefully before initiating therapy.\nLaparoscopic drilling is a treatment for infertility for PCOS but isnot first line.\nCOCP is a treatment for PCOS to regulate their irregular periods but it is not for\ntreatment of infertility.\nSpironolactone (an antiandrogen) is used by endocrinologiests to help with the effects\nof hirsutism. But again, this will not help with infertility.",

  "explanation": "POST PILL AMENORRHOEA\nPost pill amenorrhoea occurs when stopping oral contraceptives does not lead to\naresumption of a normal menstrual cycle. It is described as the loss of menstrual\nperiodsfor at least 6 months after stopping birth control pills.\nPost-pill amenorrhea is believed to be due to suppression of the pituitary gland by\nthebirth control pills.\nInvestigations\nInvestigation are usually needed if menstrual cycles do not resume after 3 months\npostpill. It may be that the cause of amenorrhoea started whilst taking the\ncontraceptiveswhich induced an artificial cycle, masking the issue until they were\nstopped.\n• Ultrasonography will reveal ovaries with no signs of developing follicles andovulation\neven after having stopped the pills for 6 months\n• Blood tests showing a low level of FSH, LH and oestrogen is usually sufficient to\nconfirm the diagnosis\nTreatment\n• The first line of treatment in case of post-pill amenorrhea is waiting for a\nspontaneous remission of the amenorrhea and a spontaneous occurrence of\nperiods.\n• The time limit is usually six months. But if the woman is anxious to get her periods,\nactive treatment may be started after waiting for only three months. The standard\ntreatment of post-pill amenorrhea is by stimulating the pituitary to produce FSH and\nLH. This is done by the drug clomiphene citrate.\nAMENORRHOEA\nAmenorrhoea is the absence of menstruation. Pathological amenorrhoea is the failure\nto menstruate for at least 6 months. Amenorrhoea can be divided into:\n• Primary amenorrhoea – lack of menstruation before age 16 years or 14 in the\nabsence of secondary characteristics\n• Secondary amenorrhoea – cessation of menstrual cycles following established\ncycles.\nAetiology\n• Hypothalamic amenorrhoea\no Most common\no Usually due to low BMI or excessive exercise\n• Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\n• Hyperprolactinaemia\n• Premature ovarian failure\no Raised FSH levels\n• Anatomical problems\no Usually results in primary amenorrhoea\no Vaginal examinations to rule out imperforate hymen is important\no Pelvic ultrasound also useful to determine the pelvic anatomy (Mullerian\nagenesis)\no Anatomical problems can also cause secondary amenorrhoea (Asherman’s\nsyndrome)\n• Thyroid problems\no Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can cause amenorrhoea\nDon’t forget pregnancy as a cause of amenorrhoea\nSpecific to look for in the stems\n• Short stature – may indicate Turner syndrome\n• Hirsutism, acne (androgen excess) – May indicated PCOS or hyperprolactinaemia\n• Menopausal symptoms in women before age 40 – May indicate premature ovarian\nfailure\n• Eating disorder – May indicate anorexia nervosa\n• Galactorrhoea – May indicate hyperprolactinaemia",

  "choice_b": "Appendicitis",
  "choice_c": "Ovarian torsion",
  "choice_d": "Constipation",
  "choice_e": "Gastroenteritis",
  "answer": "Ovarian torsion",
  "explanation": "The likely diagnosis here is ovarian torsion. Although ovarian torsion cannot\nbediagnosed clinically as it is often diagnosed in theatre during a laparoscopy,\nthequestion writers want you to consider ovarian torsion as part of your\ndifferentialdiagnosis as it is one of the important gynaecologic emergencies. It is quite\nrare andonly accounts for about 3% of gynaecologic emergencies however it is\nimportant toconsider it especially given that this patient has a tender mobile mass at the\nright iliacfossa.\nIn clinical practice, appendicitis would also be part of your differential. If there was\nahistory of an ovarian mass or if a ultrasound pelvis was done which found an\novarianmass, then the surgeons would refer her to to the gynaecology team to rule out\nanovarian torsion.\nOvarian torsion presents with sudden onset of sharp, unilateral lower abdominal\npainoften with nausea and vomiting.\nIn the reproductive years, regular growth of large corpus luteal cysts are a risk factorfor\nrotation. Basically, any enlargement of the ovary is a risk factor towards an\novariantorsion.\nThe definitive diagnosis is often made in the theatre as ovarian torsion is difficult\ntodiagnose accurately and operation is often performed before the diagnosis is made.",

It is likely that she was prescribed a broad spectrum\nantibiotic which has destroyed the normal flora leading to development of vaginal\nthrush.\nIt is well known that broad-spectrum antibiotics destroy healthy bacteria and disrupt the\nvagina’s normal flora which can predispose women to develop either vaginal candidiasis\ndue to the change of the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina.\nWhy pick candidiasis and not gardnerella?\nWhile both may be good answers, candidiasis is more likely a better answer as broad-\nspectrum antibiotics that inhibit lactobacilli also inhibit Gardnerella which makes it less\nlikely to trigger bacterial vaginosis.",

  "answer": "Endometrial cancer",
  "explanation": "The idea here is to think of endometrial cancer. Any women who has postmenopausal\nbleeding should have a transvaginal ultrasound to determine the endometrial thickness.\nIf the endometrium is thick, hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy would be arranged.\nA cervical smear is offered every 5 years in the UK if in the age group of 50 to 64 years\nold. Thus, having a cervical smear that was normal 3 years ago is a usual phenomenon.\nA repeat cervical smear is not necessary.\nENDOMETRIAL CANCER\nEndometrial cancer is classically seen in post-menopausal women.\nClassically,endometrial cancer presents as postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) and,\nalthough this is\nnot the only cause, it must be excluded.\nRisk factors for endometrial cancer:\n• Obesity\n• Nulliparity\n• Early menarche\n• Late menopause\n• Unopposed oestrogen. The addition of a progestogen to oestrogen reducesthis risk\n(e.g. In HRT). The BNF states that the additional risk is eliminated if aprogestogen is\ngiven continuously\n• Diabetes mellitus\n• Tamoxifen\n• Polycystic ovarian syndrome\nFeatures\nIn PLAB, they will always present with postmenopausal bleeding\nInvestigation\n• First-line investigation is trans-vaginal ultrasound - a normal endometrialthickness (<\n4 mm) has a high negative predictive value\n• Hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy gives the definitive diagnosis\nManagement\nIs beyond the scope for PLAB.

  "choice_c": "Prolactinoma",
  "choice_d": "Hypothyroidism",
  "choice_e": "Premature ovarian failure",
  "answer": "Premature ovarian failure",
  "explanation": "The diagnosis of premature ovarian failure usually needs two raised levels of FSH(more\nthan 40 IU/L) taken at least four weeks apart. In this question, since she isamenorrheic\nwith raised FSH and LH and a normal prolactin level, the most likelydiagnosis would be\npremature ovarian failure. Women with premature ovarian failurealso have low estradiol\n(usually < 50 pmol/l).\nPREMATURE OVARIAN FAILURE\nPremature ovarian failure (Premature ovarian insufficiency) is defined as the onset\nofmenopausal symptoms and elevated gonadotropin levels before the age of 40 years.\nItoccurs in around 1 in 100 women.\nCauses\n• Idiopathic - the most common cause\n• Chemotherapy (this can be temporary, as recovery of ovarian function canoccur,\nespecially in younger women)\n• Radiation\n• Autoimmune disease\n• Bilateral oophorectomy or surgical menopause\nPresentation\n1. The most common presentation is amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea (which may\nnot necessarily be accompanied by hot flushes)\n2. Infertility\n3. Other features are similar to those of the normal climacteric symptoms:\n• Hot flashes\n• Night sweats\n• Irritability\n• Poor concentration\n• Decreased sex drive\n• Dyspareunia\n• Vaginal dryness\nTests:\nFSH levels:\n• FSH test should be undertaken in women aged under 40 years in whommenopause is\nsuspected\n• Two raised levels (more than 40 IU/L) taken at least four weeks apart arediagnostic\nSerum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measurement alone can be used to\ndiagnosethe disease. The anterior pituitary secretes FSH and LH at high levels due to\nthedysfunction of the ovaries and consequent low estrogen levels.\nManagement:\n• hormone replacement therapy (HRT) until at least the average age of themenopause\n(51 years)\n(The average age of the menopause in women in the UK is 51 years)\nImportant Notes:\nDo NOT use early menopause and premature ovarian failure interchangeably\n• The term early menopause is used for those women who go through theirmenopause\nbetween 40-45 years\nDo NOT use premature menopause and premature ovarian failure interchangeably\n• Premature ovarian failure is sometimes referred to as premature menopause, but\nthe two conditions aren't exactly the same. Women with premature ovarian failure\nmay have irregular or occasional periods for years and may even become pregnant.\nWomen with premature menopause stop having periods and can't become\npregnant.",

  "explanation": "There is always concern about women with sickle cell disease using hormonal\nmedications as there is the fear that their blood vessels would be blocked by blood\nclots.\nThe first step towards picking an answer here is using UKMEC as a guide:\n• Sickle cell disease is considered UKMEC 2 for copper IUD as there are concerns of\nincreased risk of blood loss with its use\n• Sickle cell disease women may use progestogen-only implants, depot\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or progestogen only pill (POP) as evidence\nconcludes that these do not have adverse effects on haematological parameters\n(UKMEC 1)\n• Mirena coil (IUS) is also considered UKMEC 1 and is generally associated with\nreduced blood loss.\nAs COCP and IUD are UKMEC 2, they are definitely not going to be the right options\nwhen there are better alternatives (UKMEC 1)\nSo why pick DMPA over POP or IUS in this question?\nDepot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is a long-acting injectable contraceptive\nwhich may reduce menstrual bleeding or cause amenorrhoea with the additional\nbenefits that it is preferred in women with sickle cell disease becaue it reduces the\nfrequency and severity of painful crises.\nRemember this note: Whilst all three (POP, IUS and DMPA) are completely safe to use\nin patients with sickle cell disease, evidence shows that DMPA reduces the severity of\nsickle crisis pain.",

  "explanation": "It is worth remembering that maternal age is a risk factor for placental abruption and\nthose over 35 years are at greater risk. In this stem an age of 42 was used.\nAlthough trauma may elicit placenta abruption, majority of abruptions do not have a\nbackground history of injury to the abdomen. Back pain can be a presentation of\nplacenta abruption if the placenta is located posteriorly.\nThis needs to be dealth with rather urgently with an emergency caesarean section as\nfetal distress is often followed by fetal death in abruptions.\nPLACENTAL ABRUPTION\nPlacental abruption is the premature separation of a normally placed placenta resulting\nin maternal haemorrhage behind placenta or lost through cervix.\nThe cause is not known but associated factors include:\n• Pre-eclampsia\n• Multiplarity\n• Trauma\n• Maternal age\n• Cocaine\n• Smoking\nClinical features\n• Abdominal pain is constant\n• Very tender and tense uterus (woody hard)\n• Bleeding, which may be accompanied by pain\n• Fetal distress or fetal death\n• Maternal signs of hypovolemic shock if bleeding is severe\nSevere abruption can result in haemorrhagic shock with acute tubular necrosis from\nprofound hypotenion. Disseminated intravascular coagulation can result from release\nof tissue thromboplstin into the circulation from the disrupted placenta. One should not\nlook at the extent of vaginal loss as an indicator of severity of abruption as maternal\nhaemorrhage may be much much greater (it is just concealed behind the placenta)\nManagement\n• Resuscitation and delivery if presence of fetal distress or maternal compromise.",

She was recently treated for pelvic inflammatory disease with\nantibiotics as an outpatient but did not complete her course of antibiotics. A\nurine HCG is negative. Cervical motion tenderness was noted when doing a\npelvic examination. She has a temperature of 38.6 C and a pulse rate of 95\nbeats/minute. What is the SINGLE most appropriate action>?",
  "choice_a": "Obtain triple swabs and await results of sensitivities to determine",
  "choice_b": "Prescribe oral doxycycline 100 mg BD and oral metronidazole 400 mg BD",
  "choice_c": "Prescribe intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g OD with oral doxycycline 100 mg BD",
  "choice_d": "Prescribe intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g OD only",
  "choice_e": "Prescribe oral ofloxacin 400 mg BD and oral metronidazole 400 mg BD",
  "answer": "Prescribe intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g OD with oral doxycycline 100 mg BD",
  "explanation": "This patient clearly needs to be admitted for antibiotics. An outpatient therapy\nhasalready failed. She has signs and symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease. She\nhas ahigh temperature and tachycardia.\nOne of the more common inpatient regimens for pelvic inflammatory disease is\nIVceftriaxone 2g daily plus IV doxycycline 100mg twice daily (oral doxycycline may\nbeused if tolerated) followed by oral doxycycline 100mg twice daily plus\noralmetronidazole 400mg twice daily for a total of 14 days. Intravenous therapy should\nbecontinued until 24 hours after clinical improvement and then switched to oral.\nAlthough it’s stated that we use intravenous doxycycline as part of the antibioticregimen,\nthis is usually not the case as Intravenous doxycycline is not currently licensedin the\nUK.\nWhilst taking triple swabs is appropriate, we should not wait for results before\ncommencing antibiotics. Antibiotics should be commenced immediately as to avoid\ncomplications such as tubo-ovarian abscess or tubal damage leading to infertility. Once\nculture and sensitivity results are available, change of antibiotics may be required. The\nchange usually involves ofloxacin as gonorrhoea is increasingly resistant to\nfluorquinolone in the UK.\nOPTIONS FOR MANAGEMENT OF PID\nOutpatient management of PID\n• IM ceftriaxone stat plus oral doxycycline and oral metronidazole for 14 days; or\n• Ofloxacin and metronidazole orally for 14 days\nInpatient management of PID\n• IV ceftriaxone and IV doxycycline followed by oral doxycycline and oralmetronidazole\nfor 14 days; or\n• IV ofloxacin and IV metronidazole for a total of 14 days",

  "answer": "Ultrasound abdomen and pelvis",
  "explanation": "A hysterosalpingography is a type of radiographic evaluation that looks at the uterusand\nfallopian tubes predominantly as part of investigation for infertility. It uses acontrast\nmaterial that is injected into the cervical canal that appears on real-time X-\nray(fluoroscopy) to visualise the fallopian tubes to determine if the tubes are partially\norfully blocked. If the fallopian tubes are patent, the contrast medium will fill the\ntubesand spill out into the abdominal cavity.\nComplications associated with a hysterosalpingogram include the possibility of\nanallergic reaction to the dye or infection (endometritis or salpingitis), which\nareuncommon. Uterine perforation or fallopian tube perforation like in this stem are\nalsopossible complications, but these are very rare.\nIf a perforation were to occur, the patient may have bleeding intraabdominally and\nanultrasound scan would be a good start to evaluate the severity of the bleeding.\nThepicture given in this stem with a low BP, rapid heart rate, abdominal rigidity and\nabsentrash does point towards a likely intra abdominal bleed.\nIn a real clinical setting, a laparoscopy or laparotomy would be a more suitable optionas\nshe is clinically unstable. As these options are not provided, ultrasound would be\nthenext best investigation.",

  "choice_d": "HRT should be used until serum hCG is normal",
  "choice_e": "No contraception needed after evacuation of contents of the uterus",
  "answer": "Barrier contraception should be used until serum hCG is normal and follow up is",
  "explanation": "Serum and urine samples of hCG concentrations are extremely important.\nIn hydatidiform mole, hCG levels are likely to be raised excessively (especially\nincomplete moles). Management would involve surgical evacuation, after which the\nhCGlevels are expected to return to a normal, non-pregnant level.\nWe would like the hCG to go down towards a normal level but If it plateaued or if\nhCGlevels rise after evacuation, chemotherapy is indicated.\nThis is the reason it is so important not to get pregnant during the time that hCG\nlevelsare decreasing as if one were to get pregnant, hCG levels would increase again\nand wewill not know if it is due to the hydatidiform mole or the new pregnancy.\nThe best advice to give is use barrier contraception until serum hCG is normal and\nfollow up is complete. Fortunately, in the UK, women who have a molar pregnancy are\nenrolled into a national follow-up programme based where they can have repeated hCG\nmeasurements. For example, follow up for molar pregnancies in England are done in\nCharing Cross Hospital where they have a Trophoblastic Tumour Screening and\nTreatment Centre.\nThe previous guidance for oral contraception use was to use only once hCG levels have\nnormalised. However, the advice is now changing and the latest advice is that oral\ncontraception has no role in increasing the risk of invasive mole or choriocarcinoma\nfrom developing and hence oral contraception may be used after molar evacuation,\nbefore hCG returns to normal values.",

  "explanation": "Serum progesterone (Mid-luteal cycle progesterone) is tested one week before\namenstrual period is expected. Example, on day 21 of a 28 day menstrual cycle. In\nthiscase, since she has regular 32 day menstrual cycles, the serum progesterone\nshould betaken on day 25 (32 days - 7 days = day 25).\nA serum progesterone more than 30 nmol/L is consistent with ovulation and no\nfurtherbiochemical assessment is required.\nAs part of the management for infertility, FSH and LH is usually taken in clinics.However\nin this context, since her menses are regular, it is less important. It is usuallymeasured if\nthere is menstrual irregularity to help exclude conditions like prematureovarian\ninsufficiency (LH and FSH both raised), polycystic ovarian syndrome (LH:FSHratio\nincreased) and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (LH and FSH reduced).",

  "choice_d": "Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP)",
  "choice_e": "Progestin-Only pill",
  "answer": "Nexplanon®",
  "explanation": "The key to choosing the correct answer here is to take into account firstly the fact\nthatthis woman has fibroids which are distorting her uterine cavity and the fact that\nanytype of pill is not an option.\nDepo-provera, even though a viable option, isn’t the correct option for this stem.Depo-\nprovera has a dosing interval of 13-16 weeks which is a pretty long time, but outof all\nthe options is not the longest time.\nAn Intra-Uterine System (Mirena) which is the favorite of British examiners is not\nthechoice here because insertion of an intra-uterine device would be difficult due to\nthefibroid uterus that is distorting the uterine cavity. The use of an Intra-Uterine\nSystem(Mirena) is contraindicated in women with congenital or acquired uterine\nanomaly,including fibroids if they distort the uterine cavity.\nIn actual fact and in clinical practice, having a large fibroid that distorts the uterine cavity\nis NOT a contraindication for insertion of a mirena coil. Gynaecologist still use mirena\ncoils for patients with large fibroids that distort the cavity. While it is true that the risk of\nexpulsion of a mirena coil is greater if the fibroid is large, there is no reason why it\ncannot first be tried. However, for the purpose of the exam, since the prescribing leaflet\ndoes mention that it is contraindicated if fibroids distort the uterine cavity, please do not\nchoose the mirena coil as the answer.\nNexplanon® is the only contraceptive implant on the UK market. Nexplanon® is a 4\ncmflexible rod containing 68 mg etonogestrel (a progestogen) which is released\nslowlyinto the systemic circulation following subdermal insertion in the upper arm. It\nmust beremoved after three years when it can be replaced immediately.

The best\nmanagement here is to administer varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) as it is\neffective when administered up to 10 days after contact.\nChickenpox exposure in pregnancy\nChickenpox is caused by primary infection with varicella zoster virus. Shingles\nisreactivation of dormant virus in dorsal root ganglion. In pregnancy there is a risk\ntoboth the mother and also the fetus, a syndrome now termed fetal varicella syndrome\nFetal varicella syndrome (FVS)\n• risk of FVS following maternal varicella exposure is around 1% if occurs before 20\nweeks gestation studies have shown a very small number of cases occurring\nbetween 20-28 weeks gestation and none following 28 weeks\n• features of FVS include skin scarring, eye defects (microphthalmia), limb\nhypoplasia, microcephaly and learning disabilities\nOther risks to the fetus\nshingles in infancy: 1-2% risk if maternal exposure in the second or thirdtrimester\nsevere neonatal varicella: if mother develops rash between 5 daysbefore and 2 days\nafter birth there is a risk of neonatal varicella, which may befatal to the newborn child in\naround 20% of cases\nManagement of chickenpox exposure\nPLAB usually would test your knowledge on 3 of these scenarios:\n1. Who gets checked for Varicella antibodies?\nIf the woman’s immunity to chickenpox is unknown and if there is any doubtabout\nprevious infection, or if there is no previous history of chickenpox orshingles, serum\nshould be tested for VZV IgG. This can usually be performedwithin 24–48 hours and\noften within a few hours if the laboratory can accessserum stored from an antenatal\nbooking blood sample. At least 80% of womentested will have VZV IgG and can be\nreassured.\n2. Who gets VZIG?\nIf the pregnant woman is not immune to VZV and she has had a significantexposure,\nshe should be offered VZIG as soon as possible. VZIG is effectivewhen given up to 10\ndays after contact.\nNote: If the immune status of the woman is unknown, the administration ofVZIG can be\ndelayed until serology results are available\nNote: VZIG has no therapeutic benefit once chickenpox has developed andshould\ntherefore not be used in pregnant women who have developed achickenpox rash.\n3. Who gets oral aciclovir?\nOral aciclovir should be prescribed for pregnant women with chickenpox ifthey present\nwithin 24 hours of the onset of the rash and if they are 20+0weeks of gestation or\nbeyond.\nIn summary:\n1. Pregnant exposed to chicken pox → Check women’s immunity (previous infection,\nvaricella antibodies)\n2. Not immuned → Administer VZIG\n3. If develop chicken pox rash → Administer oral aciclovir",

Basically, extremes\nofboth ages. Headaches, epigastric pain, flashing lights are all symptoms of\npreeclampsiawhich is confirmed by having protein in the urine with a BP > 140/90.\nThe first thing to do here is to lower the blood pressure. Management of pregnancywith\npre-eclampsia for moderate hypertension (150/100 to 159/109 mmHg) starts withoral\nlabetalol as first line treatment.\nMagnesium sulphate is important here as well however labetalol oral should be\ngivenfirst. Remember, the question is asking for the most appropriate INITIAL\nmanagement.Magnesium sulphate takes awhile to prepare. It is an intravenous\nmedication andusually needs consultant approval and also cardiac monitoring when\ngiving theintravenous MgS04. Oral labetalol does not require any of those and it is part\nof themanagement as she is hypertensive in this stem.\nWhen is magnesium sulphate the answer?\nAccording to current NHS guidelines IV magnesium sulphate is administered for:\n• Women in a critical care setting who have severe hypertension or severe pre-\neclampsia who have or previously had an eclamptic fit.\n• OR women with severe pre-eclampsia who are in a critical care setting if birth is\nplanned within 24 hours.\nObviously, hospitals have their own local guidelines and many do not follow the above\nguidance.",

While the British Committee of Standards in Haematology has\ngiven strict definitions of when to give iron tablets, in real life,many gynaecoloists would\nhave prescribed iron tablets in this case. Again, it depends on hospital guidelines, but\nfor the PLAB test, it is important to follow national guidelines.",

  "question": "A 33 year old woman comes to the emergency department complaining of right\nsided abdominal pain for the last day. She vomited once earlier today. She gives\na history of missing a period. A urine pregnancy test was found to be positive. A\ntransvaginal ultrasound scan reveals an empty uterus. On examination, she is\nfound to be tender at the right iliac fossa with no signs of peritonism. She is\nafebrile and observations are stable. What is the SINGLE most appropriate next\nstep in management?",
  "choice_a": "Laparoscopy",
  "choice_b": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) blood test",
  "choice_c": "Repeat ultrasound in a week",
  "choice_d": "Laparotomy",
  "choice_e": "Culdocentesis",
  "answer": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) blood test",
  "explanation": "It is clear here that she has an ectopic pregnancy. The be more specific, this is a\npresentation of an unruptured ectopic pregnancy. The fact that there are no signs of\nperitonism, no shoulder tip pain or per vaginal bleeding and observations are normal\nmeans that a ruptured ectopic is unlikely.\nAs she is haemodynamically stable with severe right abdominal pain, a laparoscopic\napproach to the surgical management of tubal pregnancy is warranted however we\nwould need to obtain a serum beta-hCG test first. With the results of the serum\nbetahCG, we would be able to plan the next step in management. If the serum beta-\nhCG was less than 1500 IU/litre and patient is clinically stable with pain resolving, then\nwe would prefer expectant management where we would just observe. The reason\nbehind this, is that one cannot be sure of the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy when\nthe serum beta-hCG is less then 1500 IU/litre as it could very well be an intrauterine\npregnancy that is just too small to see on a scan at the moment. If a beta-hCG was\nmore than 1500 IU/litre, we would expect to see a gestational sac in the uterus.\nMeaning if the beta-hCG was more than 1500 IU/litre and nothing can be found in the\nuterus on a transvaginal ultrasound, the diagnosis of an ectopic can be certain.\nLaparotomy would be the choice if the patient is clearly haemodynamically unstable.\nThe reason for this is laparotomy is quicker than a laparoscopy.\nCuldocentesis was previously used to diagnose a ruptured ectopic pregnancy by the\npresence of free fluid in the pouch of Douglas. However, ultrasonography is noninvasive\nand has largely replaced culdocentesis where available.",

  "question": "A 26 year old woman is now 21 days postpartum and would like contraception.\nShe has a fear of needles and would like a contraception that is reversible as she\nwants to coceive again in 6 months. She is currently breast feeding. What is the\nSINGLE most appropriate contraception?",
  "choice_a": "Progestogen only implants",
  "choice_b": "Depo-Provera",
  "choice_c": "Intrauterine system",
  "choice_d": "Combined oral contraceptive pill",
  "choice_e": "Progestogen only pill",
  "answer": "Progestogen-only pill",
  "explanation": "Intrauterine system and progestogen only implants are not suitable for use in this\nwoman as she would like to become pregnant in 6 months.\nShe is afraid of needles, thus contraceptive injections such as the Depo-Provera\ninjections are not suitable.\nCombined oral contraceptives should not be used in any woman less than 6 weeks\npostpartum. In breast feeding woman, COCP is considered UKMEC 4 if less than 6\nweeks postpartum and UKMEC 2 if between 6 weeks to 6 months postpartum. In a non\nbreastfeeding woman, it is considered UKMEC 3 if less than 3 weeks postpartum and\nUKMEC 2 between 3 to 6 weeks postpartum.\nFor ease, just remember that the safest time to prescribe COCP postpartum is after 6\nweeks for non breastfeeding mothers and after 6 months for breastfeeding mothers.\nThere is no evidence that progestogen only pills affect breast milk or infant growth and\nthus this can be started at any time. Ideally, we should delay starting POP until 21 days\npostpartum as there is no use starting it before as she would not require contraception\nduring that time.\nPOSTPARTUM CONTRACEPTION\nMenstrual periods usually return 5 to 6 weeks after birth if the mother is not breast\nfeeding. If the mother is breastfeeding, the menstrual cycle usually return once the\nbreastfeeding is less often. It is important to remember that, women can become\npregnant BEFORE their periods return because ovulation occurs prior to menstrual\nbleeds.\nFor women who are not breastfeeding, it is reasonable to start using contraception from\n3 weeks (21 days) after the birth.\nRemember, no contraception is needed until 21 days postpartum\nSummary of postpartum contraception\n• Breastfeeding mothers – COCP after 6 months\n• Non breastfeeding mothers – COCP after 6 weeks\n• In both cases, during the period before they can start using COCP, they can use\ncondoms or progesterone only preparations.\no Women should be advised that although contraception is not required in the first\n21 days after childbirth, POP can be safely initiated immediately\no There is usually no need for any contraception use until day 21 postpartum as\novulation can only take place on day 28 and sperms can only survive 7 days\n• IUS/IUCD unless fitted within 48 hours of birth, delay until after 28 days postpartum\n(delay until 28 days as if inserted before may risk uterine perforation)",

Swabs of the\nendocervix can betaken during a speculum examination or indirectly by a vulvovaginal\nswab. These samples are suitable to be sent for nucleic acid amplification test (NAATs),\ncultures or microscopy.\nA high vaginal swab (HVS) is only worthwhile where there are recurrent\nsymptoms,treatment failure or in pregnancy, postpartum, post-abortion or post-\ninstrumentation.\nCervical cytology is a useful tool to screen for cervical cancers however it is a screening\ntool for asymptomatic patients. There is no role for cervical smears for symptomatic\npatients. Furthermore, cervical screening in the UK starts at age 25. Cervical cancer is\nextremely rare under 25 years of age.\nUNDERSTANDING GYNAE SWABS\nExternal skin Vagina EndoCervix PID\nBacterial BV GC GC\nTV (protozoa) Chlamydia Chlamydia\nFungal Candida Candida\nViral HPV HPV\nHSV HSV\nBV-Bacterial Vaginosis\nTV-Trichomonas Vaginalis\nGC-Neisseria Gonorrhoeae (Gonococcus)\nHPV-Human Papillomavirus\nHSV-Herpes Simplex Virus\nIn general, vaginal infections (BV, TV, Candida) cause a lot of discharge compared with\ncervical infections (GC, Chlamydia)\nSwabs\nThree swabs (“triple swabs”) are usually taken to screen for infection in symptomatic\nwomen.\nSwab1 “High vaginal Stuart’s Medium Posterior Fornix TV, BV (“heavy\nswab (HVS) growth of\nanaerobes”),\nCandida & Group B\nStrep\nSwab 2 Stuart’s Medium Endocervix GC\n“Endocervical swab\n(ECS)”\nSwab 3 Chlam swab Endocervix (cells) Chlamydia\n“Chlamydia”\nStuart’s medium is basically agar and charcoal, and is a standard transport medium for\nmost microbiological specimens.\nChlamydia can be identified by immunological techniques (eg.

Swabs\nshould be taken from the endocervix, and need to be taken in a particular way (usually\nrotated within the endocervix for 10 or 20 seconds) in order to obtain cells.\nCERVICITIS (CHLAMYDIA AND NEISSERIA GONORRHOEAE) DIAGNOSIS\n• Usually asymptomatic\n• Can present with vaginal discharge, low abdominal pain, intermenstrual bleeding of\npostcoital bleeding\nDiagnosis\n• Endocervical or vulvovaginal swab with NAAT, culture or microscopy\nIn the UK, screening asymptomatic heterosexual patients for gonorrhoea involves using\nNAAT. A first pass urine is collected for males and a vulvovaginal swab (which may be\nself taken) are collected for females. If NAAT results show positive for gonorrhoea, a\nculture needs to be sent prior to starting antibiotics if possible. This is to test for\nsusceptibility and resistant strains.\nDiagnosis in detail\n• Endocervical swab in transport medium (charcoal preferably) is to diagnose\ngonorrhoea\n• Endocervical swab for a chlamydia nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is to\ndiagnose chlamydia\n• If examination is declined, a self-taken vulvovaginal swab for C. trachomatis and N.\ngonorrhoeae for NAAT may be an option and is more sensitive in women than urine\ntesting.",

  "question": "A 34 year old African woman has been trying to conceive for the past 2 years.\nShe has suffered from heavy menstruations for the past 3 years and a recent\ntransvaginal ultrasound shows two large submucosal fibroids and one intramural\nfibroid. Her partner has had a sperm analysis which was found to be normal.\nWhat is the SINGLE most appropriate management?",

  "choice_d": "Levonorgestrel intrauterine system",
  "choice_e": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue",
  "answer": "Myomectomy",
  "explanation": "This woman is trying to conceive. The only option to preserve fertility here is a\nmyomectomy.\nEndometrial ablation is a very good option to decrease menorrhagia however the\nprocedure involves using electrical currents or heated water to destroy the endometrium\nwhich could result in infertility. This procedure is therefore NOT recommended for\nwomen who still want children. It is also important to note that endometrial ablation is\nnot used in patients with large fibroids. It is primarily used in patients with heavy\nmenstrual bleedings due to endometrial hyperplasia without fibroids, but it can also be\nused to treat small submucosal fibroids.\nUterine artery embolisation (UAE) is an alternative procedure to a hysterectomy or\nmyomectomy for treating fibroids. It is performed by radiologist and involves embolizing\nthe uterine arteries to shrink the fibroids. It is recommended for women with large\nfibroids however it is not recommended if the woman is trying to conceive as it reduces\nblood to the uterus significantly.\nThe levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is a small, plastic, t-shaped device\nplaced in your uterus that slowly releases progestogen. It also acts as a contraceptive\nand thus should not be used for a woman trying to conceive.\nGnRH analogues essentially shrink the fibroids however they would grow back once the\nmedication is stopped. Its primary use is so that it is easier to remove the fibroids during\nsurgery. As GnRH analogues inhibit ovulation, it would prevent pregnancy from\noccurring. This would be a suitable option given that it was combined with a\nmyomectomy.\nIt is also important to note that if she does decide to go for a myomectomy, she would\nneed to be counselled of the risk of uterine rupture in the future if she would become\npregnant especially during labour. Her obstetrician would need to weigh the risk and\nbenefits of a normal delivery and consider a caesarean section due to the risk of a\nuterine rupture.\nFIBROID LOCATIONS\nSubmucosal fibroids\n• Are located beneath the endometrium and bulge into the uterine cavity\nIntramural fibroids\n• Are located within the muscular uterine wall\n• Most common type of fibroid\nSubserosal fibroids\n• Located on the external surface of the uterus and project to the outside of the uterus.",

As this has already been\ngiven and dehydration managed, intravenous antiemetics is the next best answer since\nonly intramuscular cyclizine has been given. Regular antiemetics such as promethazine\nor cyclizine are often tried first in many early pregnancy units. If this fails,\nprochlorperazine intramuscularly or orally can be added on. If patient continues to\nvomit, intravenous metoclopramide or ondansetron can be used on top of the already\nprescribed regular antiemetics.\nAdvice such as eat little and often should be given.\nThiamine is also used in hyperemesis gravidarum and should ideally be given to all\nwomen admitted with prolonged vomiting. This is to prevent Wernicke’s encephalopathy\nwhich is due to vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency.

  "explanation": "Antepartum haemorrhage is seen here. Two of the most common causes are placental\nabruption and placenta praevia. Other causes include local causes like bleeding from\nthe vulva, vagina or cervix (cervical polyp or cervical carcinoma). It is not uncommon to\nfail to identify a cause for APH (over 30% of APH are of unknown origin)\nThe most important investigation is an ultrasound. This helps us rule out causes such\nas placenta praevia if the placenta is seen to be high. Usually, pregnant women would\nhave had a scan at 20 weeks which would show the location of the placenta. Note that\nplacenta praevia is usually painless bleeding.\nPlacenta abruption is a clinical diagnosis and should be considered if the pain is\ncontinuous. The abdominal pain usually has a sudden onset.\nVasa praevia would also be in the differential as it is another cause of painless bleeding\nvaginally.\nKleihauer is an important test to perform for any woman with a significant antepartum\nhaemorrhage who is rhesus negative. It is a is a blood test used to measure the amount\nof fetal haemoglobin transferred from a fetus to a mother’s bloodstream. Note however\nthat this question is clearly asking about investigations that would lead to a diagnosis.\nKleihauer test will give not provide any input for a differential. It is merely a test to\ndetermine the required dose of anti-D immunoglobulins to inhibit the formation of Rh\nantibodies in a Rh negative mother to prevent Rh disease in future pregnancies with a\nRhesus positive fetus.\nIt is worth mentioning that if the question was asking for the SINGLE best action and a\nCTG was within one of the options, that would usually be the best action. The reason\nbehind this is placenta abruption is part of the differential and if the CTG shows fetal\ndistress, the baby would need to be delivered immediately.

  "explanation": "The diagnosis of premature ovarian failure usually needs two raised levels of FSH\n(more than 40 IU/L) taken at least four weeks apart. In this question, since she is\namenorrhoeic with raised FSH and LH and a normal prolactin level, the most likely\ndiagnosis would be premature ovarian failure. Women with premature ovarian failure\nalso have low estradiol (usually < 50 pmol/L)",

  "explanation": "This lady is having a seizure but at the same time she is experiencing signs and\nsymptoms of magnesium sulphate toxicity.\nMagnesium sulphate toxicity is characterized by confusion, loss of reflexes (deep\ntendon reflexes), respiratory depression, and hypotension. In obstetric woman with\nmagnesium sulphate toxicity, the following need to be performed:\nIf only loss of patellar reflex or respiratory rate less than 10 breaths/minute:\n1. Stop magnesium sulphate maintenance infusion\n2. Send magnesium sulphate levels to laboratory urgently\n3. Consider administration of intravenous calcium gluconate 1 g (10 ml) over 10 minutes\nif there is concern over respiratory depression. Calcium gluconate is the antidote\n4. Withhold further magnesium sulphate until patellar reflexes return or blood\nmagnesium sulphate level known\nIf cardiorespiratory arrest (due to magnesium sulphate toxicity)\n1. Crash call\n2. Position woman in left lateral tilt position and initiate CPR\n3. Stop magnesium sulphate maintenance infusion\n4. Administer intravenous calcium gluconate 1 g (10 ml) over 10 minutes. Calcium\ngluconate is the antidote\n5. Intubate immediately and manage with assisted ventilation until resumption of\nspontaneous respirations\n6. Send magnesium sulphate levels to laboratory urgently\nIn general we do not use diazepam or phenytoin as an alternative to magnesium\nsulphate in women with eclampsia. However, since she is still having a fit, and\nmagnesium sulphate toxicity is suspected, we are not able to use magnesium sulphate\nand thus diazepam would be the option here. Note however, we would only use it as a\nsingle dose, since prolonged use of diazepam is associated with an increase in\nmaternal death.\nIf there were no features of magnesium sulphate toxicity in this question, recurrent\nseizures are treated with either a further bolus of 2 g magnesium sulphate or an\nincrease in the infusion rate to 1.5 g or 2.0 g/hour.\nThe fetus should be continuously monitored with CTG. The woman in this stem is 38\nweeks pregnant, and so plans for delivery should be made once stabilised but there is\nno particular hurry and a delay of several hours to make sure the correct care is in hand\nis acceptable assuming that there is no acute fetal concern such as a fetal bradycardia.",

  "explanation": "This patient may just be having signs and symptoms of perimenopause. If so, we could\neasily just do nothing and have no investigations performed. As this is not an option\ngiven, the next best option would be to arrange a transvaginal ultrasound scan.\nTransvaginal ultrasounds are useful as an intiial investigation for irregular heavy vaginal\nbleeding even in the perimenopausal period with its primary use to look at endometrial\nthickness as a thick endometrium would prompt a referral for a hysteroscopy and\nendometrial biopsy to exclude endometrial cancer.\nThe reason we say that she is perimenopausal and not menopausal is because\nperimenopause includes the period beginningwith the first clinical, biological, and\nendocrinological features of the approaching menopause, such as vasomotor symptoms\nand menstrual irregularity whereas menopause is defined as 1 year of amenorrhoea\nafter the age of 50 years old (alternatively 2 years of amenorrhoea after the age of 45).\nFibroids may also be a cause of irregular heavy bleeding, but at this age group, it has\nless of an impact as fibroids tend to decrease in size once reaching perimenopause and\nmenopause. This is because of the decrease in oestrogen and progesterone which are\nhormones involved in stimulating growth of the fibroids.\nThe confusion that people have with this question is that they are looking for a test that\nis used to diagnose menopause. A key point worth remembering from NICE guidelines\nin 2015 is that the diagnosis of menopause in healthy women above the age of 45 years\nshould be based on sym-ptoms and menopausal pattern and thus we should NOT\nroutinely check FSH. FSH levels tend to fluctuate in the perimenopausal period and so\nare unhelpful in diagnosing menopause in women above the age of 45.\nWhen isFSH useful?\nIt is useful in the diagnosis of premature ovarian failure or early menopause (< 45 y).\nTwo FSH levels would be required and they are taken 4 to 8 weeks apart. FSH also\nhas its use in decisions regarding stopping contraception however it is unlikely to be\nraised.\nSerum estradiol and progesterone is not helpful and it is not recommended by NICE in\ndiagnosing menopause.\nKey point to remember in this question:\nA transvaginal ultrasound scan may be considered for woemn with atypical symptoms\nof menopause which would involve heavy irregular bleeding.",

  "answer": "Transdermal estradiol and progestogen patches",
  "explanation": "Hormone replacement therapy like oestrogen and progestogen patches are indicated\nhere as she is having menopausal symptoms. This systemic treatment can also\nalleviate symptoms of vaginal dryness and symptoms of urinary frequency.\nA vaginal oestrogen cream or pessary would be appropriate if the patient only had\nsymptoms of vaginal dryness without the other symptoms of menopause like hot\nflushes. In such cases, there is no need for a systemic treatment as topical treatment\ncan alleviate symptoms.\nThe history of a myocardial infarction is irrelevant. The relation between HRT and\ncardiovascular disease is controversial. The National Institute for Health and Care\nExcellence (NICE) states that HRT does not increase cardiovascular risk when started\nin women aged under 60 years and does not affect the risk of dying from cardiovascular\ndisease and hence the presence of cardiovascular risk factors is NOT a contraindication\nto HRT.",

  "explanation": "Although the clinical scenario here looks like placenta abruptio, one important diagnosis\nthat we need to rule out as well is a placenta praevia for which initial the investigation of\nchoice is an ultrasound. An ultrasound cannot exclude placental abruption, which is a\nclinical diagnosis.\nPlacenta praevia usually presents with a painless vaginal bleed however the abdominal\npain in this stem could very well be mild contraction pains.\nWith every episode of bleeding, a rhesus-negative woman should have a Kleihauer test\nand be given prophylactic anti-D immunoglobulin however this is should not be done in\nan acute setting as the first investigation. A Kleihauer-Betke test can wait.\nIt is worth mentioning that if the question was asking for the SINGLE best action and a\nCTG was within one of the options, that would usually be the best action. The reason\nbehind this is placenta abruption is part of the differential and if the CTG shows fetal\ndistress, the baby would need to be delivered immediately. There is no time to wait\naround for an ultrasound.\nSpeculum examination is important to exclude a cervical cause of bleeding such as\nchlamydia but ideally this should be done after the ultrasound scan rules out placenta\npraevia.",

  "choice_c": "Endometrial ablation",
  "choice_d": "Levonorgestrel intra-uterine system",
  "choice_e": "Mefenamic acid",
  "answer": "Combined oral contraceptive pills",
  "explanation": "Combined oral contraceptive pills suppresses production of gonadotrophins and is\nthought to reduce menstrual blood loss by up to 50%. It can improve dysmenorrhoea,\nlighten periods, regulate the cycle, improve premenstrual symptoms, COCP is very\nuseful in adolescence. Also note that tranexamic acid is also effective.\nAlthough levonorgestrel intra-uterine system is first line for menorrhagia, it is difficult to\nfit in a nulliparous woman as her cervix has not yet been dilated before. However, there\nhas been more and more research regarding the use of levonorgestrel intrauterine\nsystems in nulliparous woman and some clinicians would prefer levonorgestrel intra-\nuterine system to combined oral contraceptives. Their argument is that the\nlevonorgestrel intra-uterine systems such as Jaydess® may be fitted more easily, as the\nframe is smaller and narrower compared to the Mirena® IUS. In this situation, she is\nnot sexually active so preference should go towards combined oral contraception to\ncontrol the bleeding as a girl her age might feel uncomfortable with a speculum\nexamination.\nNSAIDS such as mefenamic acid may decrease menstrual blood loss by up to 20–30%\nand also significant decreases in dysmenorrhoea. But it will not regulate her periods\nwhereas COCP will regulate an irregular cycle.\nNICE have suggested that these medical management of heavy menstrual bleeding\nshould be considered in the following order:\n1. Levonorgestrel-releasing hormone\n2. Tranexamic acid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or combined\noral contraceptives\n3. Norethisterone (15 mg) daily from days 5 to 26 of the menstrual cycle, or infected\nlong-acting progestogens.\nThere are certain situations where one might choose a different order.\nThe summary to answering these type of questions are as below:\n• Dysmenorrhoea in a young girl – Mefenamic acid\n• Dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, and irregular menstrual cycles in a young girl –\nCOCP\n• Dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, and irregular menstrual cycles in sexually active\nwomen (or para 1 or more) – Levonorgestrel intra-uterine system",

  "choice_c": "Cone biopsy",
  "choice_d": "Large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) procedure",
  "choice_e": "Endocervical swab",
  "answer": "Colposcopy",
  "explanation": "The first step is understanding that the screening result of mild dyskaryosis would follow\nsamples being sent for HPV testing. If mild dyskaryosis is present but there is an\nabsence of HPV testing, then this case should be referred to colposcopy. This means\nthat if HPV testing was part of the options, that would be a better answer compared to\ncolposcopy.\nThe second step is understanding what a colposcopy includes. A colposcopy involves\nvisualising the cervix using a microscope. A speculum is used to open the vagina and\nthe cervix is stained with acetic acid in the area of the transformation zone (TZ) to\nidentify the site, grade and shape of any abnormal area of cells. Iodine is then gently\napplied to the rest of the cervix to identify the complete area of abnormality. A small\nbiopsy is usually taken to be sent to the laboratory. When an area of abnormality\nextends into the cervical canal beyond the area that can be seen with the colposcope, a\ncone biopsy is indicated. We need a colposcopy first before we can be certain if a cone\nbiopsy is required, hence the option for cone biopsy is incorrect.\nLarge loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) takes place at the end of\ncolposcopy if abnormality is obvious on colposcopy or for women who have had a\npositive biopsy result. Therefore if the option for colposcopy is present, that would take\npriority over the option for LLETZ since the question is asking for “the next step in\naction”.\nEndocervical swabs have no value in management of cervical screening test.\nEndocervical swabs are used to diagnose chlamydia or gonorrhoea.\nSUMMARY OF MANAGEMENT OF CERVICAL SCREENING TEST RESULTS\nNegative – Recall for screening as appropriate for a negative result\nInflammatory – Repeat cervical swab in 6 months, consider taking swabs for infection if\nsevere inflammation\nInadequate – Repeat sample – If results still persistently inadequate, assess using\ncolposcopy\nBorderline – Perform HPV testing on these samples – If HPV positive, refer for\ncolposcopy\nMild dyskaryosis – Perform HPV testing on these samples – If HPV positive, refer for\ncolposcopy. Note: If mild dyskaryosis and absence of HPV testing or HPV result\nunreliable or inadequate, refer for colposcopy\nModerate dyskaryosis or Severe dyskaryosis – Refer for urgent colposcopy for\nsuspected cancer (two-week wait)",

If patient continues to\nvomit, intravenous metoclopramide or ondansetron can be used on top of the already\nprescribed regular antiemetics.\nAdvice such as eat little and often should be given.\nThiamine is also used in hyperemesis gravidarum and should ideally be given to all\nwomen admitted with prolonged vomiting. This is to prevent Wernicke’s encephalopathy\nwhich is due to vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. However, the importance of thiamine in\nan acutely vomiting woman is less compared to having intravenous antiemetics.\nIntravenous corticosteroids is NOT the answer here. Corticosteroids may be used for\nintractable cases of severe hyperemesis gravidarum in secondary care but this is\nusually a consultant decision and all other measures such as intravenous antiemetics\nhave been taken to attempt to manage the patient's vomiting. The usual regimen of\ncorticosteroids if needed would be hydrocortisone 100 mg BD intravenously for 48 hour\nfollowed by prednisolone 30 to 40 mg PO daily. Intravenous antiemetics would need to\nbe attempted first before corticosteroids.",

  "choice_e": "Raloxifene",
  "answer": "Oestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy",
  "explanation": "Women who need treatment for vasomotor symptoms postmenopausally should be\ngiven hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for up to 5 years after discussing the long-\nterm benefits and risks. The rationale behind prescribing combined hormone\nreplacement therapy for a woman who still has a uterus is to prevent endometrial\nhyperplasia which could lead to endometrial cancer if only an oestrogen preparation is\nused. As she has had a hysterectomy, an oestrogen-only hormone replacement\ntherapy would be suitable as she is no longer at risk of endometrial cancer.\nSmoking is not a contraindication for HRT use. A transdermal approach would be\npreferred here as smoking can reduce the efficancy of orally administered oestrogens.\nTransdermal HRT does not inctrease the risk of venous thromboembolism whereas an\noral HRT is seen to increase venous thromboembolism by 2 to 3 folds. Since she is a\nsmoker, it would be wise to prescribe a transdermal HRT instead of oral to reduce her\nrisk of venous thromboembolism. A point to remember in case the question asks\nspecifically for the preferred route of HRT administration.\nClonidine used to be popular for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms however it\nshould not be used as first-line treatment of vasomotor symptoms as there is limited\nevidence of its efficacy and has many side effects.\nTo recap, there are three types of HRT used.\nOestrogen-only HRT\n• Used on women who have a hysterectomy or an intrauterine system in situ\nSequential (cyclica) combined HRT\n• Used in peri-menopausal women who are still menstruating or are within 12 months\nof their last period\n• Sequential combined HRT is where oestrogen is taken every day, and progestogen\nis taken sequentially (usually for the last 14 days of menstrual cycle) to induce a\nbleed.\n• Patients are often switched to continuous combined hormone replacement therapy\nafter 12 months\nContinuous combined HRT\n• Used in menopausal women (i.e. women who have had their last period more than\n12 months ago)\n• As the name suggests, continuous combined HRT is where oestrogen and\nprogestogen dose are taken daily",

It occurs\ncommonly as part of Sjogren’s syndrome. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is confirmed by\nSchirmer’s test and the treatment always includes the use of artificial tears.

  "choice_e": "Clean discharge using cotton wool soaked in water",
  "answer": "Clean discharge using cotton wool soaked in water",
  "explanation": "There has been a long debate regarding the use of topical antibiotics in bacterial\nconjunctivitis. NHS has been moving towards using self care rather than antibiotics for\ninfective conjunctivitis. For most people, use of a topical ocular antibiotic makes little\ndifference to recovery from infective conjunctivitis and up to 10% of people treated with\ntopical ocular antibiotic makes little difference to recovery from infective conjunctivitis\nand up to 10% of people treated with topical ocular antibiotics complain of adverse\nreactions to treatment. Not to mention, that the risk of a serious complication from\nuntreated infective conjunctivitis is low.\nThus, one should only consider topical ocular antibiotics if the infective conjunctivitis is\nsevere, or likely to become severe, providing serious causes of a red eye can\nconfidently excluded. It would seem reasonable to consider infective conjunctivitis to be\nsevere when the person considers the symptoms to be distressing or signs are judged\nto be severe from clinical experience. However, it is obvious that you will not be able to\ntell based on the PLAB questions if it is severe conjunctivitis or mild conjunctivitis. So a\ngood guideline that you should follow is based on time. If the patient has infective\nconjunctivitis for more than 7 days, then start the patient on topical antibiotics. If it is\nless than 7 days, then choose the option that has self-care rather than topical\nantibiotics.\nTopical steroids is always going to be the wrong answer unless it is herpes simplex\nvirus conjunctivitis. It is only used if keratitis extends deep into the stoma.\nBacterial conjunctivitis management\n• Most cases of infective conjunctivitis do not need medical treatment and clear up in\none to two weeks.\n• Gently clean away sticky discharge from your eyelids and lashes using cotton wool\nsoaked in water.\n• If the decision is made to use antibiotics → chloramphenicol drops is the drug of\nchoice. Chloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of activity and is the drug of choice\nfor superficial eye infections. It is bacteriostatic, with a relatively broad spectrum of\naction against most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.\nTypes of conjunctivitis:\nBacterial conjunctivitis Viral conjunctivitis Allergic conjunctivitis\n• Purulent discharge • Serous discharge • Bilateral symptoms\n• Eyes may be ‘stuck • Recent URTI • Itch is prominent\ntogether’ in the morning • Preauricular lymph • May give a history of\nnodes atopy\n• May be seasonal (due\nto pollen) or perennial\n(due to dust mite,\nwashing powder or\nother allergens)",

  "explanation": "This is a case of oculomotor nerve palsy. Diplopia, mydriasis, ptosis, outward\ndownwarddeviation of the eye as described here are clinical features of oculomotor\nnerve palsy.An oculomotor nerve palsy can be associated with vascular disorders such\nas diabetes,or particularly posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Other causes\ninclude spaceoccupying tumours, infarction. abscess and trauma.\nAngiographic imaging studies are often necessary in the evaluation of acute\noculomotornerve palsy. A computed tomographic angiography would be a good option\nhere to help exclude a posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Note that this can also\nbe done with a magnetic resonance angiography. MRI would also be useful as it is a\nmore sensitive imaging technique than CT scan for picking out a small intraparenchymal\nbrainstem lesion, such as infarction, small abscess, or tumor however CT scan is more\nsensitive than MRI to demonstrate subarachnoid hemorrhage. All of these have\npotential to cause an oculomotor nerve palsy.\nOculomotor nerve palsy\n- The initial sign is often a fixed dilated pupil which does not accommodate\n- Then ptosis develops\n- Unopposed lateral rectus causes outward deviation of the eye.

  "explanation": "The most important diagnosis here to exclude would be giant cell arteritis. An old man\nwith symptoms of headache and pain on chewing are classic features.\nCentral retinal artery can be affected by giant cell arteritis. Approximately 10% of\npatients with ocular involvement in giant cell arteritis experience a central retinal artery\nocclusion.\nThe sudden loss of vision in one eye and the pale retina with cherry red spots seen in\nthe macula are diagnostic for central retinal artery occlusion.\nCentral retinal artery occlusion\nCentral retinal artery occlusion occurs when the central retinal artery occludes before\nitbranches out as it emerges from the optic nerve, resulting in almost complete\nhypoxiaof the inner retina.\nPresentation\n- Sudden (over a few seconds)\n- Unilateral painless visual loss\n- In 94% of cases, vision is usually reduced to counting fingers (worse suggeststhat the\nophthalmic artery may also be affected\n- There may be a history of amaurosis fugax (amaurosis fugax precedes loss ofvision in\nup to 10% of patients)\n- There is no redness of the eye\nExamination:\n- An afferent pupil defect appears within seconds and may precede retinalchanges by 1\nhour. Ophthalmoscopy reveals:\no A retina that appears white or pale\no Cherry red spot at the macula\no Attenuation of the vessels\nWhat is an afferent pupillary defect?\nAfferent defects (absent direct response) is when the pupil won’t respond to light,\nbutconstricts to a beam in the other eye (consensual response). Constriction\ntoaccommodation still occurs.\nInvestigations\nIn the acute setting, diagnosis is usually clinical and investigations are aimed atruling\nout underlying diseases. The most important cause to rule out is giantcell arteritis\nbecause, with appropriate and timely intervention, the visual loss isreversible and the\nfellow eye will be protected.\nManagement\nIf the patient presents within 90-100 minutes of onset of symptoms, you couldtry firm\nocular massage.

It is\nimportantto remember the symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma worsen when the\npupilsare dilated (e.g. in a dark room).\nThe history of having her eyes checked but the optician gives us the idea that either:\n1. A mildly illuminated room like of an opticians room would dilate the pupils enough to\nworsen symptoms.\n2. Topical mydriatics was applied in which case led to pupillary dilation which can push\nthe iris into the angle and precipitate AAC in anyone with narrow angles.\nAngle closure glaucoma (ACG) is associated with a physically obstructed\nanteriorchamber angle.\nAcute angle closure glaucoma\nAlso called acute glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma\nIn acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG) there is a rise in IOP secondary to\nanimpairment of aqueous outflow. Factors predisposing to AACG include:\n- hypermetropia (long-sightedness)\n- pupillary dilatation\nIt presents with an eye that is red, severely painful,and associated with a semi-\ndilatednon-reacting pupil. Headaches and decreased visual acuity are common.\nSymptomsworsen with mydriasis (e.g. watching TV in a dark room). Coloured haloes\naround lightsmay be seen by patients. Palpation of the globe will reveal it to be hard.\nCornealoedema results in dull or hazy cornea. Systemic upset may be seen, such as\nnausea andvomiting and even abdominal pain.\nNote: The acute attack is usually unilateral; however, long-term management will be\ntoboth eyes.\nMedical\nInitial medical treatment typically involves all topical glaucoma medications that are\nnotcontra-indicated in the patient, together with intravenous acetazolamide.\nTopical agents include:\n- Beta-blockers - eg, timolol, cautioned in asthma.\n- Steroids - prednisolone 15 every 15 minutes for an hour, then hourly\n- Pilocarpine 1-2%\n- Acetazolamide is given intravenously (500 mg over 10 minutes) and a further250 mg\nslow-release tablet after one hour\n- Offer systemic analgesia ± antiemetics.\nThis should tide the patient over until they are able to be seen by a dutyophthalmologist\nwho will assess the situation at short intervals until the acute attack isbroken. These\ntreatments may be repeated depending on the IOP response and acombination of these\nmedications will be given to the patient on discharge. The patientwill remain under close\nobservation (eg, daily clinic reviews or as an inpatient).Subsequent treatment is aimed\nat specific mechanism of closure.\nSurgical\nPeripheral iridotomy (PI)\nThis refers to (usually two) holes made in each iris with a laser. This is toprovide a free-\nflow transit passage for the aqueous. Both eyes are treated, asthe fellow eye will be\npredisposed to an AAC attack too. This procedure canusually be carried out within a\nweek of the acute attack, once corneal oedemahas cleared enough to allow a good\nview of the iris.\nSurgical iridectomy\nThis is carried out where PI is not possible. It is a less favoured option, as it ismore\ninvasive and therefore more prone to complications.",

  "explanation": "Optic neuritis is the likely diagnosis here. It usually presents with acute or\nsubacuteunilateral decrease in vision and eye pain particularly on movement. The fact\nthat shehas multiple sclerosis is a huge hint. Visual field loss is a known feature of optic\nneuritis.Some may argue that scotoma can also be present in optic neuritis, but in\nreality\nmonocular visual field loss is more frequently seen.\nTo understand the reason behind the patient’s pupils dilating when the light stimulus\nisdirected to the affected eye (left eye), one has to understand the principles of\ntheMarcus Gunn test. In the Marcus Gunn test, light stimulation of the normal\neyeproduces full constriction in both pupils. Immediate subsequent stimulus of\ntheaffected eye produces an apparent dilation in both pupils since the stimulus\ncarriedthrough that optic nerve is weaker. The affected eye still senses light and\nproducespupillary sphincter constriction to some degree but it’s less compared to the\nnormaleye. This is specifically seen in optic neuropathy such as optic neuritis.\nBoth central scotoma and monocular visual loss can be seen in optic neuritis and in\nactual fact, central scotoma is more common. The rationale behind monocular visual\nloss as the more more appropriate answer compared to central scotom is that this\npatient presents with a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). This tells us that it is\nlikely the whole optic nerve that has been damaged rather than a part of it. Central\nscotomas are dependent on which part of the optic nerve is affected. If the whole optic\nnerve is affected, this would result in monocular visual loss.",

It occurs\nwhen the force that holds the retinal detachment fails which results in accumulation of\nfluid in the subretinal spaces. The two most common predisposing factors are extreme\nmyopia and surgical extractionof cataracts. It is associated with age and it is rarely\nseen under 40 years old.\nClinical Presentation\n• The classic symptom is photopsia (flashing lights).\n• A common presentation is blurry vision developing in one eye without pain or\nredness.\n• The patient may complain of seeing \"floaters;' as well as flashes at the periphery of\nvision.\n• A good descriptive term used by patients is \"it feels like a curtain coming down\" or\n“it feels like a dark shadow across my vision” – this occurs as the retina falls off the\nsclera behind it.\nRemember this:\nDetachment presents with 4 ‘F’s :\n• Floaters\n• Flashes\n• Field loss\n• Fall in acuity\nDiagnosis\n• Direct ophthalmoscopy\no Grey opaque and wrinkled retina that balloons forward.\nTreatment\n• Patients should lean their heads back to promote the chance that the retina will fall\nback into place.\n• The retina can be mechanically reattached to the sclera surgically, by laser\nphotocoagulation, cryotherapy, or by the injection of expansile gas into the vitreal\ncavity (gas will press the retina back into place)\n• Scleral buckling is another option where a \"buckle,\" or belt, can be placed around\nthe sclera to push the sclera forward so that it can come into contact with the retina.",

Not\ntomention, that the risk of a serious complication from untreated infective conjunctivitisis\nlow.\nThus, one should only consider topical ocular antibiotics if the infective conjunctivitis\nissevere, or likely to become severe, providing serious causes of a red eye can\nbeconfidently excluded. It would seem reasonable to consider infective conjunctivitis\ntobe severe when the person considers the symptoms to be distressing or signs\narejudged to be severe from clinical experience. However, it is obvious that you will not\nbeable to tell based on the PLAB questions if it is severe conjunctivitis or\nmildconjunctivitis.

  "explanation": "To choose the correct answer, we first need to know the diagnosis. This is a Colles'\nfracture.\nColles' fracture is a fracture of the distal radius with dorsal displacement of fragments. It\ntypically occurs from a fall onto an outstretched hand that results in forced dorsiflexion\nof the wrist. The characteristic dinner fork deformity makes it easy to recognize, along\nwith the classical history. The management of the type of cast to be used in a Colles'\nfracture is still heavily debated however, the patient’s age and any potential disability\nshould be taken into consideration. We should always aim to tailor management for\nindividual patients and their needs rather than apply generalized rules across the\npopulation.\nThis patient is elderly and she has mild dementia. In this situation, the best type of\nmanagement for her should be a complete cast below the elbow in order to maximally\nimmobilize her wrist and prevent further injury to her wrist, thus causing potential\ncomplications.\nA backslab is the preferred method of management for younger patients\nSurgical reduction is reserved for intra-articular fractures and if there is any intraarticular\nincongruity.

It is a bone density scan and is used to measure\nbone loss mainly in patients with suspected osteoporosis.\nSerum calcium levels are also performed in suspected bone metastasis because, in\nbone metastases, calcium can be released into the bloodstream leading to\nhypercalcemia. However, there is a difference between “SINGLE most appropriate\ninvestigation” and “SINGLE most initial investigation”. Serum calcium would be the\nmost initial investigation but not the most appropriate unless of course this patient were\nto portray signs and symptoms of hypercalcaemia.\nSkeletal survey is useful for multiple myeloma where tumours are seen as “punched\nout” lesions. It is inappropriate for this case.\nWhat if an MRI scan was one of the options?\nAn MRI scan is considered the gold standard for detecting metastatic spinal cord\ncompressions and NICE recommends this should be performed within 7 days if there is\npain alone or within 24 hours if there is pain and neurological signs. MRI scans are a\nbetter modality for bone metastasis than scintigraphy, however, there is a great cost to it\nif a full body MRI would be required. For targeted focal lesions, an MRI can be useful if\nperformed at the site of metastatic disease but since this patient has shoulder and spine\ninvolvement without neurological abnormalities, a nucleaer scan would be a better\nchoice.\nIf there were neurological symptoms (e.g. limb weakness, radicular pain, difficulty in\nwalking, sensory loss or bladder or bowel dysfunction), suspect metastatic spinal cord\ncompression and perform an urgent MRI of the whole spine.",

Usually in slipped upper femoral epiphysis, there\nis limited hip motion, and as the hip is flexed the thigh goes into external rotation and\ncannot be rotated internally.\nSLIPPED UPPER FEMORAL EPIPHYSIS (SUFE)\nSlipped upper femoral epiphysis is an orthopedic emergency. The typical patient is a\nchubby boy, around age 13. They complain of groin (or knee) pain and are noted to be\nlimping.\nIt is caused by the displacement of the femoral epiphysis (growth plate) in relation to the\nfemoral neck. It is the commonest cause of a limp in a boy aged 12–14 or girl aged 11–\n13 (growth spurt at puberty). In this age group, it must be actively excluded in a limping\nchild.\nThe classic presentation is a limping, obese, 13 year old boy with knee pain. The pain\ncan be poorly localised, so it may be seen as hip, groin, thigh or knee pain. Pain may\npresent acutely or with a history of days or weeks.\nRisk factors include:\n- Obesity\n- Rapid growth\n- Male—♂:♀, 3:1\nClinical features\n- The affected limb will be shorter and lies in external rotation\n- Abduction is limited.

  "explanation": "The differential in the polytrauma patient with a sudden change in the level of\nconsciousness is broad. In this particulare patient, the history of long bone fractures,\nsudden hypoxaemic respiratory failure and focal neurological findings suggests a\nspecific aetiology: fat embolism syndrom e.\nWhile it is true that pulmonary embolism in this patient is a distinct possibility since he\nhas just had surgery, it is unlikely in this scenario. By giving you a history of a femur\nfracture, the examiners are pointing you toward fat embolism as an answer. If the\nexaminers had wanted you to choose pulmonary embolism as an answer, they would\nnot have included the history of the femur fracture.\nAlthough atelectasis presents with low oxygen saturation, increased heart rate and\nbreathlessness in the history points more towards a fat embolism.\nThe patient is having a respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilating. Eventually, if not\nintubated, the patient would become acidotic.\nFat embolism syndrome is associated with long bone fractures of the lower extremities,\nusually the femur. Another group of patients that fat embolism syndrome is commonly\nseen in are those with pelvic fractures. They typically occur between 24 to 72 hours\npost fracture.\nFat embolism syndrome is a clinical diagnosis. Imaging is important to rule out other\ncauses of the symptoms however the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome can be made\nwith the classic triad of hypoxaemia, neurologic deficits, and the petechial rash\n(especially in axilla) occurs in an appropriate clinical setting. Petechial rash may not\nalways be present like in this stem as only less than half of them have petechial rashes.\nThe take home points to remember are the clinical manifestations of hypoxaemia and\nneurological impairment in the absence of other pathologies especially with a history of\nlong bone or pelvic fractures.\nTreatment for fat embolism is largely supportive while it resolves spontaneously.",

  "explanation": "This is a classic case of Achilles tendon rupture. It usually occurs in a middle aged man\nwho decides to play a sport after several months or years of not being active.\nThompson test is when the examiner squeezes the calf muscle specifically at the\ngastrocnemius-soleus complex when the patient is lying prone with his feet over the\nexamination table. If the Achilles tendon is ruptured, there will be absent plantar flexion.\nAchilles tendon rupture requires a same day review by either orthopaedics or a sports\ninjury team thus the options for referring to physiotherapist and to GP as outpatient is\nwrong.\nThe history of a DVT can throw you off and cause you to pick D-dimers as the answer.\nRequesting a D-dimer is a wrong answer as we don not suspect a DVT here. There is\nan association between Achilles tendon rupture and thromboembolism and these\npatietns are usually sent home with low molecular weight heparin for prophylaxis. The\nrisk of thromboembolism occurs because he is immobile however in this case, he has\nnot developed and we do not suspect a DVT.\nIf an imaging would to take place, it would usually be an X-ray to rule out calcaneus\navulsion fractures or an ultrasound to confirm diagnosis. MRIs for Achilles tendon\nrupture are rarely needed.\nACHILLES TENDON RUPTURE\nHistory of an Achilles tendon rupture would usually involve a repetitive jumping motion\nor a burst of sudden activity. The patient would be a middle aged man who is an\ninfrequent sports goer. He would hear an audible snap at his Achilles and would\ndescribe it as if someone kicked his heel while playing a sport. Patients would find\ndifficulty walking on tiptoes or plantar flexing against resistance on their affected leg.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis is usually made clinically\nThe Simmonds’ triad is worth remembering for the exam. It involves the patient in a\nprone position with their feet hanging off the examination table with the following:\n• Affected leg rests in a more dorsiflexed position\n• Palpable gap at the heel of the affected leg\n• No plantar flexion on calf squeeze test of the affected leg\nA video of Simmonds’ triad can be found here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PvgvUV8N8U\nManagement\n• Same day referral to orthopaedics\nThe Orthopaedic team would usually assess the injury to decide if surgery or\nnonsurgical management is required. They may request for an X-ray to exclude any\ncalcaneal avulsion fractures. Prophylaxis for thromboembolism may be offered by the\northopaedic team as well as immobilisation may contribute to the development of a\nDVT.\nMajority of cases would go down the non-surgical treatment route involving casting,\nboot and physiotherapy. The tendon heals on its own but casting is essential to prevent\nit from healing at different lengths from the other leg.\nIf the patient is a young athlete, surgery may benefit as it reduces the risk of recurrence.",

A DEXA scan is the most commonly used investigation to assess\nfracture risk by measuring bone density and would be the best option here.\nOSTEOPOROSIS RISK ASSESSMENT\nElderly patients, especially women with untreated osteoporosis are much more likely to\nsustain a fracture if they fall. Therefore, patients at risk of osteoporosis should be\ninvestigated and treated. The risk for osteoporosis include long-term use of\ncorticosteroids, low body mass index, smoking history, heavy alcohol use, immobility,\nand untreated premature menopause.\nQFracture® and FRAX® are 2 tools used commonly by GPs to assess the risk of hip\nfractures and major osteoporotic fractures. NICE suggests that QFracture® is the\npreferred tool to use. Both tools predict the risk of fractures over 10 years. You can\nfind the online tools here to have a try:\n• QFracture® – https://qfracture.org/\n• FRAX® - https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX/tool.aspx?country=1\nPatients whose fracture risk is more than 10% based on the risk assessment tools are\noffered DEXA bone scans to measure the bone mineral density (BMD). Once a DEXA\nbone scan has been performed, the BMD is added into the FRAX tool to recalculate the\nfracture risk which guides the management. The Qfracture ® cannot be recalculated\ntaking BMD measurements into account. A patient with a bone mineral density on a\nDEXA scan of greater than/equal to -2.5 standard deviations from the mean of a\nhealthyyoung woman, otherwise known as the T-score, indicates osteoporosis and\nbone protection would be warranted.\nPatients who are at high risk with a history of a hip or vertebrae fragility fracture can skip\nthe DEXA scan and go straight onto bone protection medications.",

It is\nusual for patients that have been in high impact collisions to present with injury of the\ngreat bones, such as the hip and the femur.\nThe posterior tibial artery supplies the lower limb and carries blood to the posterior\ncompartment of the leg and plantar surface of the foot. The answer is incorrect.\nThe dorsalis pedis artery is an artery of the foot. This answer is also incorrect.\nThe great saphenous vein (long saphenous vein) is a subcutaneous, superficial vein of\nthe leg. If this vessel had been injured during the accident, the patient would have\npresented with an open wound and clear blood loss. This answer is, therefore, also\nincorrect.\nThe only answer that makes sense in the choices is the femoral artery. The femoral\nartery is a large artery in the thigh and the main arterial supply to the leg. It enters the\nthigh from behind the inguinal ligament as the common femoral artery. In a high-impact\naccident that has resulted in a femur fracture, we would be most concerned about injury\nto the femoral artery.

  "choice_d": "Forearm extensors",
  "choice_e": "Wrist pronators",
  "answer": "Wrist extensors",
  "explanation": "This patient is suffering from a condition called tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis. In\nthis condition, there is pain where the common extensor tendon arises from the lateral\nepicondyle of the humerus. The muscle group that is affected are the wrist extensors.\nWhy is the answer not forearm extensors?\nThe primary condition affects the extensors of the forearm and the specific muscle that\nis affected is the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle. Although this muscle is located\nin the forearm, its function is to extend and abduct the wrist. Since the question asks for\nwhich muscle group is affected, the answer of wrist extensors is therefore correct.\nThe fact that this person is a painter is a huge clue as the motion of using a paint brush\nor paint rollers creates stress at the insertions of the extensor muscles which are\nlocated at the lateral epicondyle. Painters generally lift heavy objects and heavy tools in\na repetitive motin which worsens the symptoms of tennis elbow. The combination of\ntenderness at the lateral epicondyle and pain upon resisted wrist extension are\nindicative of a tennis elbow.\nTENNIS ELBOW\nRemember, tennis elbow does not always have to happen in tennis players and the\nother term for it which is lateral epicondylitis is not strictly correct either but there are no\nbetter terms to use for this condition.\nTennis elbow is causd by overuse and partial tearing of the extensor digitorum muscles\nwhich typically cause tenderness over its insertion at the lateral epicondyle of the\nhumerus.\nTennis elbow is developed by doing any form of activity that involves repeatedly twisting\nyour wrist and using your forearm muscles. Some examples:\n• Playing racquet sports\n• Using shears while gardening\n• Using a paint brush or roller while decorating\n• Activities that involve fine, repetitive hand and wrist movements\nExamination would likely reveal tenderness at the lateral epicondyle and pain (again at\nthe lateral epicondyle) on resisted dorsiflexion of the wrist.\nIt is a self limiting condition. However, it can often last for several weeks or months.\nThe treatment involves rest to the injured area, cold compress, avoiding activities that\nstrain affected muscles and tendon. Painkillers such as Paracetamol and NSAIDs may\nhelp ease mild pain and inflammation. Other treatments involve physiotherapy.",

  "explanation": "A mallet finger is an injury of the extensor digitorum tendon of the fingers at the distal\ninterphalangeal joint. It results from hyperflexion of the extensor digitorum tendon. It\noccurs when a ball (such as a softball, basketball, or volleyball), while being caught, hits\nan outstretched finger causing it to bend (flex) further than normal and rupture or stretch\nthe extensor digitorum tendon. Without the use of the extensor digitorum tendon, the\nfinger stays bent (flexed) resembling a mallet.\nSplint DIP in extension for 6 to 8 weeks is usually adequate to manage this.",

It occurs when the force applied to a bone results\nin bending of the bone such that the structural integrity of the convex surface is\novercome.

  "choice_d": "Chondrosarcoma",

  "answer": "Osteosarcoma",
  "explanation": "Malignant bone tumoursare uncommon in children but the two that you need to know\nare osteosarcoma and Ewing’s sarcoma as these are the 2 most common malignant\nbone tumours affecting children.\nOsteosarcoma arises most often at the end of bones where growth occurs. It is the\nmost common type of primary bone cancer and it accounts for just over half of\nchildhood bone tumours. Two-thirds of childhood cases occur between 10 to 14 years\nage. Males are more often affected. The common sites that are affected in\nosteosarcoma are lower end of femur or upper tibia (60%), upper end of humerus (10%)\nand pelvic bones (10%). Since the knee is the most commonly affected, in the exam,\nthe stem would always give you a scenario of a teenage boy with pain around the knee.\nOsteosarcoma is characterised by intermittent, unilateral bone pain that is worse at\nnight. Sometimes patients might present with a sudden, unexplained fracture. This is\ndue to structural weakness of the affected bone. There are often no other complaints\nassociated with this type of cancer.\nOne of the main differences between osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma is that\nsystemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and malaise are generally absent in\nosteosarcoma however they can be present in Ewing sarcoma. The tumour cells in\nEwing sarcoma produce cytokines which causes a fever. In reality, the constitutional\nsymptoms and signs of fever, weight loss and malaise are only present in 10-20% of\npatients with Ewing sarcoma however look out for this in the exam, as if present could\nhelp you select Ewing instead of osteosarcoma as the likely diagnosis.\nTo summarise, the exam will probably give you a scenario of osteosarcoma. This will\nusually be a teenage boy who presents with the complaint of knee pain. If you see this\nscenario in the exam, pick osteosarcoma. If the patient in the scenario is a teenage boy\ncomplaining of tiredness, fever and weight loss as well as bone pain, pick Ewing\nsarcoma.\nThe other options here are less likely.\nChondromas are an extremely rare, slow growing type of bone cancer. They usually\ngrow in the bones of the skull or in the spinal cord.\nChondrosarcoma is a primary bone cancer most often found in adults aged between 30\nand 60 years old however, it can affect anyone at any age. It is a cancer of the cartilage\ncells within the bone.\nFibrosarcoma, as the name suggests, is a cancer of fibroblast cells. It can involve the\nfemur, tibia and mandible in adults.",

This is a typical PLAB 1 stem: there is a\nchild that accidently ingests an unknown bottle of medications. For TCA overdose, look\nfor widened QRS, peaked T waves, hyperkalemia as main clues. Note that in young\nchildren (< 5 years) the symptoms would usually be drowsiness, lethargy, and in this\nstem indications of seizure. In adolescents and adults, you would see more\npredominant signs of hypertension turning into hypotension and ventricular\ndysrrhythmias along with the widened QRS clue.\nTricyclic antidepressant overdose in Paediatrics\nPresentation:\n- Child ingesting an unknown bottle of medication\n- Lethargy, drowsy\n- +/- Coma or seizure\n- ECG - widened QRS, peaked T waves (indications of hyperkalemia)\nDiagnosis:\n- Urea, electrolytes, toxicology screen\n- ECG\n- Arterial blood gas\nTreatment:\n- ABCDE protocol\n- If within 1 hr of ingestion and >4mg/kg - activated charcoal\n- Sodium bicarbonate\n- Correct electrolytes if necessary\nTRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT (TCA) OVERDOSE\nTricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose should always be considered potentially life-\nthreatening. They can deteriorate very rapidly sometimes within 1 hour of ingestion.\nClinical features\n• Dilated pupils\n• Dry mouth\n• Dry flushed skin\n• Urinary retention\n• Drowsiness and altered mental state leading to coma\n• Hypotension\nECG monitoring for TCA overdose is essential. The important ECG finding suggestive\nof TCA poisoning is QRS widening (> 100 ms). Broad complex tachycardias may occur\nwhich are life threatening.\nTwo popular stems in the exam where the answer is likely to be TCA overdose is the\nyoung child that takes his/her grandparents’ medication who later becomes drowsy and\nlethargic. Another is an elderly person who has a terminal illness and wants to take\nhis/her own life who comes in the ED having dry and flushed and pupils are dilated.\nTCA’s are a prescription only medication and so you should think about how the person\nin the stem obtained the medication before you choose an answer.",

  "choice_e": "None of the above",
  "answer": "Low dose antibiotic prophylaxis daily",
  "explanation": "This is a diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).\nFor urology questions in paediatrics in this exam, pay particular attention to VUR and\nurinary tract infections.\nDo not go into details for these questions, just know the basic presentation, diagnosis\nand management according to current guidelines. Note to have a basic understanding\nthat the severity of VUR is graded and management is according to the grade. In this\ncase the child is between grade II to III. Therefore, according to guidelines, she would\nstart with low dose antibiotic prophylaxis before consideration for surgery.\nVesicoureteral reflux\nCondition where urine flows retrograde from bladder into ureters/kidneys\nPresentation\n• Most children are asymptomatic\n• Increases risk of urinary tract infection → Thus, symptoms of a UTI:\no Fever\no Dysuria\no Frequent urination\no Lower abdominal pain\nDiagnosis\n• Urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity → initial investigation\n• Renal ultrasound → initial investigation → might suggest the presence of VUR if\nureteral dilatation is present\n• Micturating cystourethrogram → gold standard\n• Technetium scan (DMSA) → for parenchymal damage (seen as cortical scars)\nTreatment\n• VUR grade I-IV - start with low dose antibiotics prophylaxis daily (i.e. trimethoprim)\n• If above fails and/or parenchymal damage consider surgery - reimplantation of the\nureters\nThe International Reflux Study has found that children can be managed nonsurgically\nwith little risk of new or increased renal scarring, provided they are maintained infection\nfree. Remember, the goal of treatment is to minimize infections, as it is infections that\ncause renal scarring and not the vesicoureteral reflux. Thus, the importance of\ncontinuous antibiotic prophylaxis outweighs surgery in most cases. Note that during\nearly childhood, the kidneys are at higher risk of developing new scars. So it is\nparticularly important to start parenteral antibiotic treatment for patients with\nvesicoureteral reflux before febrile breakthrough infections.\nFor patients with frequent breakthrough infections, definitive surgical or endoscopic\ncorrection is preferred. Surgical correction should also be considered in patients with\npersistent high-grade reflux (grades IV/V) or abnormal renal parenchyma.",

  "choice_c": "Prescribe antibiotics",
  "choice_d": "Administer corticosteroids",
  "choice_e": "Prescribe bronchodilators",
  "answer": "Refer for chest physiotherapy",
  "explanation": "Cystic fibrosis is often very difficult to manage and usually requires a multidisciplinary\nteam approach. The physiotherapist helps the patient clear the bronchial secretions by\nphysiotherapy, the paediatrics often have to prescribe antibiotics to treat the chest\ninfection and prescribe pancreatic enzymes supplements to correct nutritional deficits.\nAll the answers given have a place in the management of cystic fibrosis and the real\nchallenge here is picking which one is the best.\nChest physiotherapy involves techniques to clear the mucous such as postural drainage\nwehre gravity-assisted positions are used to aid drainage. Other techniques include\nchest percussion and positive expiratory-pressure device to aid dislodgement and\nexpectoration of sputum. This would definitely improve this patient’s symptoms of\ndyspnoea and mucopurulent sputum.\nAlthough oxygen usually forms part of the initial treatment for anyone presenting with\ndyspnoea, it is not the most appropriate management for this patient since his oxygen\nsaturations are normal.\nAntibiotics are indicated in patients with cystic fibrosis only in an acute exacerbation of\nthe disease or as prophylaxis in childhood. The prophylactic antibiotic to offer is\nflucloxacillin as it works well against respiratory Staphylococcus aureus infection for\nchildren with cystic fibrosis. It is offered from the point of diagnosis up to age 3, and\nconsider continuing up to 6 years of age. If a mild exacerbation is present, antibiotics\ncan be prescribed for 2 weeks.\nBronchodilators, specifically beta-2 agonists, are indicated in management of patients\nwith cystic fibrosis but they only benefit some patients who have a reversible component\nof their airway obstruction.\nThe question becomes more difficult to answer because dyspnoea and increased\nsputum production are considered early signs of an exacerbation in which case\nbronchodilators, antibiotics and even corticosteroids have a role. However, since his\nobservations are well and there is no history of fever or signs of infection, chest\nphysiotherapy still remains the best choice amongst the answers.",

  "answer": "Non-accidental injury",
  "explanation": "This is a seemingly tough question which in actuality, is quite simple. The normal weight\nfor a 3 year old male child is around 14kg. We can see from admission that his weight is\nway below the average for his age group. The fact that his weight improved in hospital\nand declined upon discharge is highly suspicious of negligence. Another clincher to this\nfact is the frequent hospital admissions.\nWe cannot say this child has leukaemia or cystic fibrosis (although it is possible)\nbecause there is no evidence in the stem to suggest this. Thus, the best answer is\nnonaccidental injury.\nIn certain questions like this one, there is insufficient information to properly know for\ncertain which is the correct answer. This type of questions may reflect those that appear\nin the exam. Options C and B are still the top choices. Make one of these your choices\nand move on to the next question. Do not overthink this as it could waste valuable time\nin the exam.\nNon-accidental injury/neglect:\n• Frequent attendance or unusual patterns of attendance to health care services,\nincluding frequent injury.\n• Failure to access medical care appropriately (including non-attendance for routine\nimmunisations, delay in presentation).\n• Unsuitable explanations. Explanations which are inconsistent over time or between\npeople, or which are not consistent with the presenting features.\n• There is evidence of failure to thrive.\n• Parents or carers do not administer prescribed medication.\n• Inexplicably poor response to treatment.\n• Reporting of new symptoms as soon as previous ones resolve.",

Examination results are consistent with obstructive\njaundice therefore option is E. Jaundice in options B and C would occur within 24 hours\nof birth. Galactosemia would present with vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive with\njaundice. Liver would not be hard or enlarged.\nBILIARY ATRESIA\nBiliary atresia is notoriously asked during exams so one should know this topic inside\nand out.\nPresentation:\n- Jaundice with pale stools and dark urine\n- Usually would present in 3-4 weeks of life\n- Splenomegaly is not usually a feature unless presentation is late\n- Failure to thrive is a result of poor absorption\nDiagnosis:\n- Abdominal ultrasound (initial investigation)\n- Cholangiogram (definitive diagnosis)\nTreatment:\nKasai procedure = hepatoportoenterostomy\nIt is extremely important to diagnose biliary atresia early as without intervention, chronic\nliver failure will develop which usually leads to death before age 2.\nNEONATAL JAUNDICE\nPhysiological jaundice:\n- This results from increased erythrocyte breakdown and immature liver function.\n- It presents at 2 or 3 days old, begins to disappear towards the end of the first week\nand has resolved by day 10.\n- The bilirubin level does not usually rise above 200 μmol/L and the baby remains well.\nEarly neonatal jaundice (onset less than 24 hours):\nNote: The most common pathological causes of neonatal jaundice within 24 hours are:\nRhesus incompatibility, ABO incompatibility, G6PD and sepsis\n- Haemolytic disease: eg, haemolytic disease of the newborn (rhesus), ABO\nincompatibility, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, spherocytosis.\n- Infection: congenital (eg, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes\nsimplex, syphilis) or postnatal infection.\n- Crigler-Najjar syndrome or Dubin-Johnson syndrome.\n- Gilbert's syndrome.\nProlonged jaundice (jaundice lasting for longer than 14 days in term infants and 21 days\nin preterm infants):\nNote: The most impoortant diagnosis not to be missed in this group is biliary atresia.\n• Hypothyroidism\no Congenital hypothyroidism is usually identified on routine neonatal biochemical\nscreening (Guthrie test)\n• Hypopituitarism.\n• Galactosaemia\n• Breast milk jaundice: the baby is well and the jaundice usually resolves by six weeks\nbut occasionally continues for up to four months.\n• Gastrointestinal (GI): biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis.\no Biliary atresia (commonly asked question)\no Neonatal hepatitis\nIt is worth knowing a little about the system for newborn jaundice in the UK. In the UK,\nfollow up care following birth for mothers and newborns are delivered by the community\nmidwives. They would come to visit the mother and newbonr at their own homes. If the\nnewborn remains jaundiced after 14 days (or 21 days for premature babies), they are\nreferred back to the hospital to see a paediatrician who would investigate further to rule\nout other rarer causes of jaundice. The most important reason that investigations need\nto be carried out for infants with jaundice lasting longer than 14 days is to diagnose\nbiliary atresia promptly, as delay in surgical treatment in this group could lead to severe\ncomplications. A split bilirubin blood test is usually performed to see the levels of\nconjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. If hyperbilirubinaemia is unconjugated, the\npaediatric team are usually reassured since biliary atresia would have high levels of\nconjugated bilirubin.",

Typically, this includes a bilateral\nanteroposterior and posteroanterior views of arms, forearms, humerus, feet, legs,\nfemur, pelvis, spine and skull.\nOnce the skeletal survey has been done, then think of the child’s protection register and\ninvolve social services. As a junior doctor you should involve your seniors prior to\nchecking child’s protection register or involving social services. The chief consideration\nis the treatment and protection of the child, so do not delay treatment of painful or\napparently lifethreatening problems, whilst awaiting an ‘expert’.\nIn every hospital system there will be a designated doctor for child protection who\nshould be available for advice. He or she will examine the child and arrange hospital\nadmission for further investigations (e.g. skeletal survey) as necessary. Social Services\nand the police may need to be involved.\nBruises\nChildren naturally sustain bruises during minor incidents as part of ‘growing up’.\nBruising over the knees and shins is a normal finding in children, particularly toddlers,\nwho are also prone to sustaining injuries to their foreheads and chins as a result of falls.\nAs well as considering the possibility of NAI, remember that bruising may occur as part\nof an unusual pathological disease process (eg Henoch–Schönlein purpura,\nhaemophilia, ITP, leukaemia, and other causes of thrombocytopenia).\nThe following bruises should prompt consideration of NAI:\n- Bruising in unusual sites (eg medial aspect of upper arms or thighs)\n- Finger ‘imprinting’ (eg grip complexes around upper limbs or slap marks)\n- Imprints or marks from other objects (eg belt, stick)\nConsider NAI in the following fractures\n- Multiple fractures of different ages\n- Rib and spinal fractures\n- Fractures in infants who are not independently mobile\n- Long bone fractures in children\nThere are a few rare bone diseases that may mimic NAI. One commonly asked in PLAB\nis Osteogenesis imperfecta. They would usually give other clues such as a blue sclerae,\ndental abnormalities and brittle bones.",

It is important to realise that in its early stages,\nKawasaki disease can mimic a viral exanthem and so it is often diagnosed as a viral\nrash and children are sent home.\nKawasaki disease and scarlet fever have many similarities such as rash, fever,\nstrawberry tongue (which was not mentioned in the stem), and cervical\nlymphadenopathy however the primary complaint of scarlet fever is usually the sore\nthroat.\nKAWASAKI DISEASE\nKawasaki disease is a febrile systemic vasculitis that predominantly affects children\nunder 5 years of age.\nThe disease is more common in Japanese children hence the Japanese name\n“Kawasaki” of whom described the disease in 1967.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis is made by clinical findings alone. Fever above 39 C for more than 5\ndays and at least 4 of the following features are diagnostic.\n• Conjunctivitis\n• Polymorphous rash\n• Extremity changes: Erythema of palms and soles that later leads to desquamation\n• Mucous membrane changes: Red, fissured lips, strawberry tongue\n• Cervical lymphadenopathy\nPrompt recognition is important as aneurysms of the coronary arteries are potentially\ndevastating complications and treatment with immunoglobulins reduces their incidence.\nThese coronary arteries are affected in around 30 percent of children within the first 6\nweeks of illness. Hence, an echocardiogram would be an important investigation during\nthe child’s stay in the hospital.\nBilatera, non-exudative conjunctival injection\nStrawberry tongue and bright red, swollen lips with vertical cracking and bleeding\nDesquamatikon of the fingers\nManagement\n• High dose aspirin – Reduces risk of thrombosis\no Once fever subsides and inflammatory markers fall, low dose aspirin is given\nuntil echocardiogram is performed at 6 weeks to exclude aneurysm\n• Intravenous immunoglobulin – If given within first 10 days, reduces the risk of\ncoronary artery aneurysms",

  "explanation": "There are two types of allergic reactions to cow’s milk protein: IgE-mediated reactions\nand non-IgE-mediated reactions.\nIgE-mediated reactions\n• Occur within two hours of milk being consumed\n• Symptoms include:\no Nausea\no Vomiting\no Colicky abdominal pain\n• Skin manifestations include:\no Pruritus\no Erythema\no Urticaria or angioedema\nNon-IgE-mediated reactions\n• Occur hours or days after ingesting milk\n• Symptoms include:\no Reflux\no Loose stools or constipation\no Perianal redness\no Abdominal pain\no Food aversion\n• Skin manifestations include:\no Pruritus\no Erythema\no Atopic eczema\nUpper and lower respiratory tract symptoms such as cough or a wheeze may be\npresent for both IgE-mediated and non IgE-mediated\nThe best way to test for IgE mediated reactions is to diagnose it with a skin prick test or\na blood test.\nThe best way to diagnose non-IgE-mediated reactions is to exclude cow’s milk from the\ndiet or to use a hypoallergenic formula such as extensively hydrolysed formula and see\nif there is an improvement in symptoms. We would normally expect improvements of\nsymptoms in 2 weeks. If symptoms still persiist whilst using extensively hydrolysed\nformula, then swap to an amino acid formula.\nNot gaining weight and reflux is seen more in Non-IgE mediated rections and thus this\nstem represents a classic scenario of a non-IgE mediated reaction and trying\nhypoallergenic formulas would be appropriate.\nKey points to remember for exam purposes:\nIf cow’s milk allergy is suspected and reaction is acute – Think IgE-mediated\nIf cow’s mil allergy is suspected and reaction is delayed (reflux, loose stools, tapering of\ngrowth) – Think non-IgE-mediated",

  "question": "A 4 month old child is brought to Accident & Emergency by her parents. She is\nfound to weigh 4.1 kg. She presents with multiple bruises on her left and right\nlower leg. Her left ankle is swollen and she refuses to move it. She appears\nirritable and she also has a runny nose. What is the SINGLE most likely\ndiagnosis?",

  "choice_c": "Non-accidental injury",
  "choice_d": "Malnutrition",
  "choice_e": "Osteogenesis imperfecta",
  "answer": "Non-accidental injury",
  "explanation": "This is a probable non-accidental injury. This infant weighs 4.1kg. For a 4 month old\ninfant this is beneath the normal weight gain line. A female infant of 4 months should\nweigh about 6.1kg and a male infant of 4 months should weigh about 6.8kg. Another\nclue to the diagnosis of NAI is the multiple bruises on her lower limbs. This is the most\ncommon site of NAI in the infant population. It arises from parents or caregivers gripping\nand pulling the infant by the legs.\nHaemophilia is incorrect because even though haemophilia is a possible diagnosis, it is\nimprobable. Haemophilia is an X-linked recessive condition and this is a female infant.\nHaemophilia CAN affect females but it is extremely rare and if they had wanted you to\npick haemophilia they would have give additional clues such as neonatal bleeding\nfollowing venipuncture, gastrointestinal hemorrhage or intracranial bleeding.\nThrombocytopenia is incorrect because it usually presents following a viral infection in\nchildren. Although it presents with bruising and petechiae, it is an improbable answer in\nthis question because the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia lies solely on blood testing\nand blood smear. You cannot make a diagnosis of thrombocytopenia based on clinical\nsigns.",

  "choice_d": "Antibiotic use has not been show to reduce renal scarring",
  "choice_e": "Surgical correction should be considered in patients with low-grade reflux",
  "answer": "Antibiotic prophylaxis is first line",
  "explanation": "Antibiotic prophylaxis should be given prior to considering surgery. When medical\nmanagement fails to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections, or if the kidneys show\nprogressive renal scarring then surgical interventions may be necessary. Surgical\ncorrections are generally reserved for the higher grade refluxes (not low-grade). The\nmain idea of antibiotic prophylaxis is to reduce risk of urinary tract infection and thus\nreduce renal scarring.\nVesicoureteral reflux\n- Condition where urine flows retrograde from bladder into ureters/kidneys\nPresentation\n- Most children are asymptomatic\n- Increases risk of urinary tract infection → Thus, symptoms of a UTI:\no Fever\no Dysuria\no Frequent urination\no Lower abdominal pain\nDiagnosis\n- Urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity → initial investigation\n- Renal ultrasound → initial investigation → might suggest the presence of VUR if\nureteral dilatation is present\n- Micturating cystourethrogram → gold standard\n- Technetium scan (DMSA) → for parenchymal damage (seen as cortical scars)\nTreatment\n- VUR grade I-IV - start with low dose antibiotics prophylaxis daily (i.e. trimethoprim)\n- If above fails and/or parenchymal damage consider surgery - reimplantation of the\nureters\nThe International Reflux Study has found that children can be managed nonsurgically\nwith little risk of new or increased renal scarring, provided they are maintained infection\nfree. Remember, the goal of treatment is to minimize infections, as it is infections that\ncause renal scarring and not the vesicoureteral reflux. Thus, the importance of\ncontinuous antibiotic prophylaxis outweighs surgery in most cases. Note that during\nearly childhood, the kidneys are at higher risk of developing new scars. So it is\nparticularly important to start parenteral antibiotic treatment for patients with\nvesicoureteral reflux before febrile breakthrough infections.\nFor patients with frequent breakthrough infections, definitive surgical or endoscopic\ncorrection is preferred. Surgical correction should also be considered in patients with\npersistent high-grade reflux (grades IV/V) or abnormal renal parenchyma.",

They\nare usually well and the jaundice resolves within 6 weeks but may also continue up to 4\nmonths. Breast milk jaundice is the most common cause of prolonged unconjugated\nhyperbilirubinaemia. It affects 15% of healthy breastfed infants.\nThe diagnosis and occasional treatment is to stop the breastfeeding (and give formula)\nfor 24 hours. When bilirubin is checked again, a significant fall would help diagnose this\ncondition, after which the infant may then be safely breastfed.

Biliary atresia causes obstructive picture where stools are pale and urine\nbecomes dark which is exactly what is seen here.\nFailure to thrive is a result of poor absorption of long-chain fats.\nThe spleen becomes palpable after the 3rd or 4th week in biliary atresia.

They would subsequently undergo a sweat test to confirm the diagnosis.\nThe symptoms vary from child to child, but as the condition gets worse over time, the\nlungs and digestive system becoming increasingly damanged. The abdominal\ndistention occurs from the malabsorption. Faltering growth is seen with untreated cystic\nfibrosis. Once diagnosis is made and effective nutritional intake is given including\nenteric-coated pancreatic replacement therapy, their growth starts to pick up again.\nPneumonia is not entirely wrong as he is probably suffering from pneumonia as well.\nHowever, since cystic fibrosis often presents with recurrent and persistent bacterial\nchest infections and the stem clearly gives a history of abdominal distention and\nsuboptimal growth, cystic fibrosis would be a better pick.",

In this stem, we all can agree that the regular oral\nmorphine dose needs to be increased.\nCalculation of the dose to give for breakthrough pain is easy once you understand it.\nThe dose of normal release morphine for breakthrough pain should be 1/6 of the total\n24 hour morphine dose.\nIn this stem, increasing the oral morphine to 120 mg BD means that the total amount of\nmorphine in 24 hours is 240 mg. Breakthrough pain dose should be 240 mg/6 which is\n40 mg. Hence, 40 mg of oral morphine should be prescribed as 4 hourly PRN in\naddition to the BD dose of morphine.\nINTERESTING FACT:\nThis method of using one sixth of the total 24 hour dose as a breakthrough dose is a\ntraditional method. Now, with the newer modified-release analgesia, some physicians\nare choosing to use only 10% of the total daily regular dose as the as-required\nbreakthrough dose as there is a better balance of analgesia with adverse effects.",

  "answer": "12 ml",
  "explanation": "Percentage concentration is based on g/100 ml so a 1% solution would be 1 g/100 ml or\n1000 mg/100. This gives you 10 mg/ml\nThis patient has already been given 20 ml of a 1% solution so he has been given 20 ml\nat 10 mg/ml. He has been given 200 mg of the drug.\nThe max dose is 4 mg/kg and this patient is 80 kg.

  "answer": "Switch oral oxycodone to intravenous morphine",
  "explanation": "Intravenous morphine would be the most suitable as he is not able to tolerate opioids\norally due to the vomiting.\nThere is no rational behind picking fentanyl patch as an option. Whilst it is true that if the\npain is stable and oral route is no longer appropriate (e.g. vomiting), fentanyl patches\nare a good choice however, the pain here is not stable. The pain was well controlled\nwith oral oxycodone of which he has now started to vomit out. It is obvious that he will\nbe in pain again. Fentanyl is a strong opioid. Due to its long half-life, it will take at least\n12 to 24 hours to achieve therapeutic drug levels and so is only of benefit in patients\nwith stable pain. If you had given this to the patient, he would be in severe pain for\nseveral hours while waiting for the therapeutic drug levels to kick in.\nFentanyl patches are usually used in cancer patients who have stable pain who are not\nable to tolerate oral medication.\nIt is not reasonable to use constipation as an excuse in this example to avoid the use of\nintravenous morphine.

This stem includes burning as one of the symptoms. The evidence of diabetic\nnephropathy and diabetic retinopathy is included here as patietns with these\ncomplications are more likely to have signs of neuropathy.\nAmitryptiline works well with neuropathic pain, and so it is the answer here.

They\nare usually used for patients who are not able to tolerate oral treatments.\nNerve blocking agents refer to local anaethetics such as lidocaine. They are usually\nonly given as a form of temporary relief such as a femoral nerve block prior to a knee\nreplacement.

  "explanation": "The question is testing your knowledge of pharmacology. The area under the curve is\nthe area underneath the graph where plasma concentration of the drug (y) is\nplottedagainst time after drug administration (x) and this is most important when looking\nat these types of questions.\nThe first-pass effect is where the concentration of a drug is reduced before it reaches\nsystemic circulation. When a drug is administered orally, it travels through the gut, then\nthrough the portal system and into the liver. The liver metabolises most drugs and toxins\nthat enter the body and only allows a certain fraction to enter systemic circulation. This\n‘first pass’ through the liver reduces the bioavailabilty of the drug in question. Drugs\nthat are administered via other routes such as the intramuscular, intravenous, and\nsublingual route bypass being metabolised by the liver and soe the bioavailabilty of\nthese drugs are greater. Simply put, a larger area under the curve means a greater\ndrug bioavailability and vice-versa. It would make sense that a drug administered orally\nwould have lesser bioavailability than a drug administered intravenously, therefore\nhepatic first pass elimination is the correct answer.\nRenal clearance of the drug does not pertain to this question at all therefore an\nincreased renal clearance of the intravenous drug and a reduced renal clearance of the\nintravenous drug is incorrect.\nBioavailability increases in patients who have liver disease since the liver is unable to\nmetabolise substances with efficancy therefore reduced hepatic absorption is incorrect.\nIncreased bioavailability of the drug is incorrect since the oral route would have a\ndecrease in bioavailability as compared to the intravenous route.",

  "question": "A 32 year old man has recently been laid off work due to his drinking habits. He\ndrinks half a litre of vodka (ABV 40%) and a pint of beer (3.5%) in a week. How\nmany units of alcohol is he drinking in a week?",
  "choice_a": "21 units",
  "choice_b": "22 units",
  "choice_c": "41 units",
  "choice_d": "42 units",
  "choice_e": "Less than 20 units",
  "answer": "22 units",
  "explanation": "One unit equals 10 ml or 8 g of pure alcohol. It is around the amount of alcohol the\naverage adult can process in an hour. In theory, there should be little or no alcohol left\nin the blood of an adult after one hour from drinking one unit. We say “in theory”\nbecause everyone is different.\nCalculating units\nFirstly, you would need to understand the basics. ABV is a measure of the amount of\npure alcohol as a percentage of the total voume of liquid in a drink. For example, a\nwine bottle that says “12% ABV” means 12% of the volume of that drink is pure alcohol.\nYou can now calculate the units based on this formula\nStrength (ABV) x Volume (ml) / 1000 = Units\nSo in essence, the number of units of alcohol in one litre of a drink can be quickly\ndetermined, as it is the same as the percentage strength of that drink. 1 litre of vodka\n(40% ABV) contains 40 units of alcohol. Since he is drinking half a bottle of vodka that\nwould be 20 units of alcohol.\nA pint is approximately 568 ml. A pint of standard beer (3.5% ABV) would equate to 2\nunits of alcohol.\nMen and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis.",

  "question": "A 30 year old man is referred to the local community addiction team for\nassessment and treatment. He has been taking heroin for a number of years and\nwould like help for his opioid dependence. Which is the SINGLE most likely\nmedication to be offered to him as first-line for community based detoxification?",
  "choice_a": "Methadone",
  "choice_b": "Lofexidine",
  "choice_c": "Naloxone",
  "choice_d": "Naltrexone",
  "choice_e": "Codeine",
  "answer": "Methadone",
  "explanation": "NICE hasproposed that either methadone or buprenorphine can be offered as a first-line\ntreatment for detoxification. Buprenorphine is not amongst the options, so methadone is\nthe answer. Methadone is an opioid receptor agonist, so it acts similarly to heroin, and\nhence it is used in opioid substitution therapy as part of the detoxification programme.\nDetoxification can last anywhere from up to four weeks in an inpatient/residential setting\nand up to 12 weeks in the community.\nMETHaDONE is the METHoD number ONE to detoxify\nLofexidine can be used for patients who would like a shorter detoxifying period, who\nhave mild or uncertain dependence, and who have decided not to use methadone or\nbuprenorphine to detoxify.\nNaloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist (opposte from methadone which is an opioid\nreceptor agonist). Its main use is reversing the effects of opioids in acute opioid\noverdose.\nNaltrexone is an opioid antagonist (like naloxone) but with a longer half life. It has a role\nas an adjuvant in preventing relapses in opioid-dependent patients who have remained\nopioid free for at least 7-10 days.\nCodeine is a weak opioid with no role in opioid detoxification.",

  "question": "A 64 year old man diagnosed with a nasopharyngeal carcinoma 6 months ago is\nhaving recent difficulty swallowing his tablets. He takes regular morphine\nsulphate 20 mg twice a day for his localised pain as part of his palliative care\nplan. He has minimal side effects from the use of oral morphine which manages\nthe pain well. His last blood test shows no liver or renal impairment. What is the\nSINGLE most appropriate action?",
  "choice_a": "Replace oral morphine with a transdermal fentanyl patch",

  "choice_c": "Replace oral morphine with intravenous morphine",
  "choice_d": "Replace oral morphine with subcutaneous morphine",
  "choice_e": "Offer a sustained-release morphine",

  "explanation": "Oral morphine is usually offered to patients with pain from progressive cancer as part of\npalliative care much like in this stem. If they have difficulty swallowing, oral medications\nwould be inappropriate. Another route to deliver the same equivalent dose of the opioid\nshould be offered.\nIn the scenario of a palliative patient with “stable” pain, patches would be the most\nappropriate way as they are easy to use and can be managed at home.\nThe doses of fentanyl are not likely to be asked at this level but for those who would like\nto know more, a transdermal fentanyl 12 microgram patch is equivalent to\napproximately 45 mg oral morphine daily.",

Her mother mentions that her daughter\nwas devastated at not getting into the university of her choice. The patient’s\nparents found her unconscious on her bedroom floor two hours later. Physical\nexamination reveals a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 11/15. Blood sampling\nwas done two hours later and showed a plasma paracetamol level that is above\nthe treatment line. A decision was subsequently made to commence intravenous\nN-acetylcysteine treatment. Which of the following is the SINGLE best\ndescription for the mechanism of action of N-acetylcysteine?",
  "choice_a": "Inhibition of interferon-alpha",

  "choice_c": "Protection from free radicals",
  "choice_d": "Formation of sulfhydryl bonds",
  "choice_e": "Decreasdes glutathione stores",
  "answer": "Protection from free radicals",
  "explanation": "When faced with a question of this type, choose the answer that makes the most sense\nin the context of the question. You already know that a paracetamol overdose causes\nliver damage. This happens because a metabolite of paracetamol decreases stores of\nthe antioxidant glutathione. Decreased stores of glutathione cause liver cells to be\ndamaged by free radicals. When N-acetylcysteine is given, it is broken down into L-\ncysteine which then gets converted to glutathione which in turn protects from damage\nfrom free radicals.\nN-acetylcysteine inhibits cytokine NF-kB and not interferon-alpha.\nIt has a minimal effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes.\nN-acetylcysteine causes the breakdown of sulfhydryl bonds. This additional effect of N-\nacetylcysteine also makes it useful as a mucolytic treatment in patients with respiratory\nconditions.\nN-acetylcysteine increases glutathione stores.",

Further questioning reveals that the patient had been started on the\ncombined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) three weeks ago. She takes no other\nmedications and has no other medical conditions. On examination, the patient’s\nright leg appears swollen below the knee. She was then given low molecular\nweight heparin (LMWH) subcutaneously. What is the SINGLE best description for\nthe mechanism of action of low molecular weight heparin?",
  "choice_a": "Inhibition of antithrombin (AT) III",

  "choice_d": "Activation of thrombin",
  "choice_e": "Inhibits clotting factors in the liver",
  "answer": "Inhibits the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin",
  "explanation": "Heparin works by binding to antithrombin (AT) III, resulting in its activation. The\nactivated antithrombin (AT) III then inactivates thrombin via the inhibition of prothrombin\n(coagulation factor II), factor Xa and other proteases of the coagulation cascade.\nRegardless of whether heparin is administered at a high dose or at a low dose or\nwhether it is delivered as low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated\nheparin (UFH), the initial mechanism of action is the same (the activation of\nantithrombin) although later interactions might differ.\nDuring the normal coagulation cascade, thrombin is converted to fibrinogen which is, in\nturn, converted into strands of fibrin. Even though heparin does decrease the\nconversion of fibrinogen to fibrin by inhibiting thrombin, this is indirectly done and the\nsingle best description of how heparin works is the inhibition of prothrombin to thrombin.",

The method is predicated on the idea\nthat atherapeutic effect is achieved as subjects confront their fears and\ndiscontinue theirescape response.

  "choice_e": "Lithium toxicity",
  "answer": "Lithium toxicity",
  "explanation": "Lithium is still used for bipolar disorder and has been proven to be a very\neffective treatment. In this stem, we see bloods that show hypercalcaemia. It is\nimportan to remember that lithium toxicity can cause hypercalcaemia. Medical\nprofessionals who deal with lithium monitoring are trained to look out for side\neffects of lithium toxicity such as severe or coarse hand shaking or tremors,\nblurred vision, abdominal pain with diarrhoea, slurred speaking, muscle twitching,\nconfusion and muscle weakness. We can see some of the symptoms here in\nthis stem.\nPatients need regular blood test to monitor lithium levels every 3 months and\nregular liver function test and urea and electrolytes every 6 months. The dose of\nlithium varies. For example, lithium carbonate is normally started at doses of 450\nto 675 mg twice daily and the lithium plasma concentration is checked in a week\nfrom starting. The doses are then adjusted according to the amount of serum\nlithium concentration. Blood tests are repeated and again the doses may be\nchanged. This is done until serum lithium concentration is in an appropriate\nrange.\nWhile there are reports of lithium causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome, the\nsymptoms of this stem do not fit as well. It is usually associated with pyrexia,\nrigidity and tachycardia of which only pyrexia is seen in this stem. Neuroleptic\nmalignant syndrome is more commonly associated with antipsychotics.\nHyperparathyroidism is a much more common cause of hypercalcaemia when\ncomparing with lithium toxicity however with calcium levels of less than 3,\nsymptoms that are descriebd in this stem (confusion, lethargy, nausea, vomiting,\nabdominal pain) are unlikely. Furthermore, hypercalcaemia does not cause\ncoarse tremors.",

If\nyou have reason to believe that he will harm himself or others, you may detain\nhim and admit him under the Mental Health Act.\nMirtazapine is an atypical antidepressant.

An example would be laughing at the death of a loved one or believing\nthat you have super powers while going through a depressive episode.\nMood congruence also describes a psychotic symptom of bipolar disorder, but, in\nthis case, the belief or action are consistent with that person’s mood.

  "explanation": "Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) should be used to treat panic disorders as\nthere is really good evidence to support its use.\nBenzodiazepines should not be prescribed for the treatment of individuals with\npanic disorder as they have poor outcome in the long term.\nRebreath into paper bags is useful in acute setting but not as prevention.\nBuspirone is an anxiolytic drug and only used to manage anxiety short term.\nBeta blockers are not mentioned as part of the management for panic disorders\nin the NICE guidelines. This is probably because beta-blockers are used to\ncontrol physical symptoms and to provide symptomatic relief rathr than a means\nto cure or to prevent panic attacks.

Beta blockers will not help prevent further\nepisodes, they only help with the physical symptoms (e.g. palpitations) during the\nepisode.\nManagement for panic disorder\nThere are really 2 options when it comes to treatment of panic disorder\nPsychological treatment\n- Has the best evidence for giving longest duration of effect\n- Involves CBT for 1 to 2 hours a week\nMedications\n- SSRI (citalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram but NOT fluoxetine)\n- If SSRIs contraindicated or no response after 12 weeks then imipramine or\nclomipramine should be offered.\n- Do NOT use benzodiazepines\nThe only pharmacological intervention that should be used in the long term for\npanic disorders is antidepressants. They have been shown to be effective in\nreducing the amplitude of panic, and reducing the frequency of panic attacks.",

  "answer": "Reduce lithium gradually and stop before pregnancy is confirmed",
  "explanation": "Despite problems with tolerability, lithium still remains the gold standard in the\ntreatment of bipolar affective disorder.\nLithium is teratogen. If a woman taking lithium is planning a pregnancy, and is\nwell and not at high risk of relapse, she should be advised to stop taking the drug\nbecause of the risk of cardiac malformations in the fetus. This should be done by\ngradual discontinuation before conception. Lithium should be reduced gradually\nover 1–3 months as abruptly stopping lithium may cause their moods to become\nquite unwell. Gradually stopping lithium is usually a decision that a psychiatrist\nwould need to take after weighing the risk of damage to fetus especially in the\nfirst trimester against the risk of untreated bipolar disorder.\nKey points from NICE CKS:\n- Do not offer lithium to women who are planning a pregnancy or pregnant,\nunless antipsychotic medication has not been effective.\n- If a woman taking lithium becomes pregnant, consider stopping the drug\ngradually over 4 weeks if she is well\n- If a woman continues taking lithium during pregnancy, check plasma lithium\nlevels every 4 weeks, then weekly from the 36th week and adjust the lithium\ndose to maintain plasma lithium levels at a therapeutic range",

Thiazide and\nrelated diuretics can cause a rapid rise in serum lithium levels leading to toxicity.\nNICE recommends avoid concurrent use unless lithium levels can be closely\nmonitored and the lithium dose adjusted as necessary. Advise patients to report\nlithium adverse effects (tremor, dysarthria, ataxia, confusion).\nAtenolol → Is a beta blocker. There has been one study which suggests that\natenolol might decrease the clearance of lithium. However, NICE guidelines state\nthat no particular precautions are warranted.

  "explanation": "Tardive dyskinesia occurs especially in patients with long-term treatments with\nantipsychotic agents. The word “tardive” means delayed, and “dyskinesia” means\nabnormal movement. Put together “tardive dyskinesia” refers to the delay\nbetween the first use of offending medication and the onset of abnormal\nmovements. It takes several months to years to develop the symptoms of tardive\ndyskinesia from the use of antipsychotics.\nIt is characterized by continuous involuntry movement of the tongue and lower\nface. The disorder can also affect the fingers, arms and legs causing either\nrapid, jerking movements or slow, writhing movements.\nHuntington’s disease usually presents at an earlier age with tremors and\nchoreiform movements.\nParkinsonism can also be caused by antipsychotic medications however it is\ncharacterised by resting tremors, rigidity and bradykinesia. The onset of\nparkinsonism as an extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotics usually occurs\nafter 1 week of administration of the offending antipsychotic drug.\nAkathisia like tardive dyskinesia and Parkinson’s can be caused by the use of\nantipsychotic medications but the symptoms involve motor restlessness. These\nare restlessness of the lower limbs where the patient would have the urge to\nmove. The word “akathisia” is derived from Greek and it means “not to sit still”.\nPatients would be seen pacing constantly, rocking back and forth or constantly\ncrossing and uncrossing legs.

  "choice_e": "Serum lithium concentration",
  "answer": "Thyroid function test (TFT)",
  "explanation": "Before treatment with lithium is commenced, tests are needed to assess both\nkidney function and thyroid function.\nThe kidneys mostly excrete lithium with minimal metabolism by the liver. In\naddition, it can also cause long term kidney damage, so kidney monitoring is\ndone at regular intervals.\nA thyroid function test is done initially because abnormal levels of thyroid\nhormones can mimic or precipitate mania and depression. It is also good\npractice to have a baseline prior to starting lithium. Thyroid monitoring is done at\nregular intervals because lithium can induce hypothyroidism.\nFollowing the initial test, anyone on lithium should have their lithium levels\nchecked 3 monthly, and TSH and renal function checked at least 6 monthly if not\nmore frequently.",

  "choice_e": "Oral amoxicilin",
  "answer": "Non-invasive ventilation",
  "explanation": "This question is testing your knowledge on the management of acute\nexacerbation ofCOPD. The reason that this is likely COPD instead of asthma is\nbecause of his age, thefact that he is a smoker, and the choice of administering\n24% of oxygen rather than100% oxygen. 24% of oxygen gives the clue that he is\non controlled O2 therapy with theattempt to maintain saturations between 88%\nand 92% to balance hypoxia, hypercapniaand pH which is seen as part of the\nmanagement for COPD.\nNon-invasive ventilation would be the next step in management as it is\nparticularlyeffective in supporting patients during an exacerbation especially\nwhen maximal medicaltreatment has not been effective like in this case. Its use is\nappropriate for consciouspatients with ongoing respiratory acidosis (< pH 7.35).\nNote that oral antibiotics should ONLY be given if there is purulent sputum or\nclinicalsigns of pneumonia. While it is common practice for all patients with an\nexacerbation ofCOPD to receive antibiotics in the hospital, it is not according to\nNICE guidelines and forthe purpose of this exam, antibiotics should not be\nadministered to manage acuteexacerbation COPD unless we suspect\npneumonia.\nThe reason why invasive mechanical ventilation is an inappropriate answer is\nthat it hasits own complications such as pneumonia, barotrauma, and failure to\nwean tospontaneous ventilation. Thus, it should not be used unless non-invasive\nventilation failsor is contraindicated such as in scenarios like respiratory arrest,\nhigh aspiration risk, orimpaired mental status.\nDoxapram is also an incorrect answer. Doxapram is a respiratory stimulant. It is\ngivenintravenously and can be used to drive respiratory rate if respiratory rate\nwas less than20 breaths/minute. In this case, the respiratory rate is 32\nbreaths/minute hence there isno problem with the respiratory drive. Its use has\nlargely been replaced by non-invasiveventilation.\nManagement of acute exacerbation of COPD\n- Antibiotics if sputum is purulent or clinical signs of pneumonia\n- Prednisolone 30mg/day for 7-14 days\n- Inhaled or nebulized bronchodilators\n- Controlled O2 therapy 24% via Venturi face mask, with oximetry → Maintain\nsaturations between 88% and 92%\n- IV aminophylline → Beneficial if the patient is wheezy and has not improvedwith\nnebulizers alone\n- Non-invasive ventilation → Effective in supporting patients during an\nexacerbation when maximal medical treatment has not been shown to be\neffective",

  "answer": "Bronchiectasis",
  "explanation": "The history of smoking here is irrelevant as smoking does not appear to be\nanindependent risk factor but smoking cessation is important as part of the\nmanagement if\nthe patient does smoke.\nThe persistent cough and copious amount of purulent sputum are symptoms\nofbronchiectasis. Measles is a childhood viral infection that is one of the\naetiologies ofbronchiectasis. Finger clubbing is not a specific sign but has been\nseen in bronchiectasisalthough not very frequently. Inspiratory crepitations and a\nchest-x ray that showstramlines give a more specific picture pointing towards\nbronchiectasis. Although theseare not diagnostic, the most probable diagnosis\namong the others is bronchiectasis. Onlya high-resolution computed tomography\n(HRCT) chest would give you the diagnosis ofbronchiectasis.\nBronchiectasis\nIs the irreversible abnormal dilatation of of small and medium sized bronchi,\nwithchronic airway inflammation. It is associated with chronic sputum production,\nchroniccough, recurrent acute chest infections, and airflow obstruction.\nAetiology\nThe disease is caused by chronic inflammation of the airways. It may therefore\nbecaused by a large number of disorders which cause inflammation and\ninfection,particularly conditions that facilitate infections, which therefore tend to\nbe recurrentand more severe and so cause damage to the lungs. In general, the\naetiology is either aone-off infectious insult or an underlying immune deficiency.\nPost-infection: childhood respiratory viral infections (measles, pertussis,influenza,\nrespiratory syncytial virus), tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia.Infection is the\nmost common cause of bronchiectasis\nImmunodeficiency:HIV infection. Always consider this as a cause in all\nages,particularly if there have been serious, persistent or recurrent infections\nConnective tissue diseasese.g. rheumatoid arthritis, Sj ِ gren's\nsyndrome,systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Ehlers-\nDanlos syndrome,Marfan's syndrome\nToxic insults:Gastric aspiration, inhalation of toxic gases\nCongenital defects:The most important one being cystic fibrosis\nBronchial obstruction and bronchopneumonia are more likely to cause a\nfocalbronchiectasis, whereas the other causes are more likely to result in diffuse\ndisease.\nAll conditions cause dilation of the airways (due to continued inflammation\ndestroyingtheir elastic and muscular structure) followed by poor mucus\nclearance, and bacterialcolonisation of collected mucus. This then can progress,\nas chronic infection causesfurther inflammation in a cyclical fashion.\nNote\n- The most important cause to exclude is CF. Even relatively mild bronchiectasis\ndiagnosed in middle age can be due to CF\n- In the PLAB examination, look out for a history of recurrent pneumonias in the\nquestion\nClinical features\n- Persistent cough with purulent copious sputum production\n- Nonspecific respiratory symptoms including dyspnoea, chest pain\nandhaemoptysis.\nBronchiectasis may progress to respiratory failure and corpulmonale\n- Coarse crackles are the most common finding, heard in early inspiration\nandoften in\nthe lower zones\n- Large airway rhonchi (low-pitched snore-like sounds)\n- Wheeze may be present\n- Clubbing is found infrequently\nDiagnosis\n- Usually made clinically, with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)\nchestfor\nconfirmation.\n- A baseline chest x-ray should be done in all patients. Early chest x-ray\nfindingsmay be\nnormal in patients with bronchiectasis. Chest x-ray in advanced casesmay show\n1 to 2\ncm cysts, crowding of the bronchi (tramlines) or ring opacities.The main value of\na\nCXR is excluding other causes of symptoms.\nTreatment\nDamaged lung cannot be repaired and so the basis of management is to prevent\nor atleast slow down further deterioration.\n- Bronchodilators, chest physical therapy, and postural drainage are used\ntocontrol and\nimprove drainage of bronchial secretions\n- If the patient smokes this must be stopped\n- Immunisation against influenza and pneumococcus\n- Long-term oral antibiotics for patients having three or more exacerbations\nperyear\nrequiring antibiotic therapy or patients with fewer exacerbations that arecausing\nsignificant morbidity should be considered for long-term antibiotics.Choice will be\ndictated by sensitivities and local microbiology advice fromsputum test results.",

  "explanation": "This woman has become acutely breathless from a pulmonary emboli. She is\nhypoxic and, as a reflex to this, is hyperventilating (as evidenced by the low\nPaCO2). As a result, she has developed an alkalosis.\nThe other options are much less likely to be the answer:\nDiabetic ketoacidosis and methanol overdose → both causes acidosis. The\nscenario that was given is alkalosis\nPanic attacks → This does cause acute alkalosis via hyperventilation (and\ntherefore low PaCO2 and a high pH), but tends to happen in the absence of\nhypoxia rather than as a response to it (as in pulmonary embolism).\nSevere vomiting → causes a metabolic alkalosis (i.e. a high pH with a high\nHCO3–). PaO2 is not likely to decrease\nTo understand this question, we have to go back to basics.\nFirst, is the patient hypoxic?\n- the Pa02 >10 kPa is normal\nSecond, is the patient acidaemic (pH <7.35) or alkalaemic (pH >7.45)\nThird, what is the respiratory component: What has happened to the PaCO2?\n- PaCO2 > 6.0 kPa suggests a respiratory acidosis (or respiratory compensation\nfor a metabolic alkalosis)\n- PaCO2 < 4.7 kPa suggests a respiratory alkalosis (or respiratory compensation\nfor a metabolic acidosis)\nFourth, what is the metabolic component: What is the bicarbonate level/base\nexcess?\n- bicarbonate < 22 mmol/l suggests a metabolic acidosis (or renal compensation\nfor a respiratory alkalosis)\n- bicarbonate > 26 mmol/l suggests a metabolic alkalosis (or renal compensation\nfor a respiratory acidosis)\nIn summary\nShe has developed respiratory alkalosis with very minimal renal compensation\ntaking into account that renal compensation usually takes around 48 hours to\nmanifest.\nARTERIAL BLOOD GASES, CAUSES\nMETABOLIC ACIDOSIS METABOLIC ALKALOSIS\n• Excess Production of Organic Acids • HCl loss\n• Ketoacidosis • Vomiting\n• Alcoholic • Excessive Administration of HCO3\n• Violent convulsions • Hypokalaemia\n• Excessive ingestion of Toxins • Hypovolaemia\n• Aspirin • Increased Renal Excretion of Acid\n• Methanol Alcohol • Diuretic therapy\n• Excess loss of HCO3 • Secondary Hypoparathyroidism\n• Diarrhoea\n• Addison’s disease\n• Retention of Organic Acids\n• Renal insufficiency of Any Cause\nRESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS\n• Airway obstruction Any event causing hyperventilation\n• Aspiration • Lung disease\n• COPD • Pulmonary embolism\n• Respiratory center depression • CNS-Respiratory stimulation\n• Circulatory collapse • Cerebral Vascular Accident\n• Cardiac arrest (Stroke)\n• Pulmonary oedema • Anxiety-Hyperventilation syndrome\n• Neurogenic causes • Salicylate Intoxication\n• Cervical spine injury • Congestive cardiac failure\n• Drugs (paralytic agents, • Mechanical ventilation\norganophosphates)\n• Multiple sclerosis\n• Restrictive effects\n• Haemothorax\n• Pneumothorax\n• Ascites",

  "explanation": "The blood results are consistent with an infection. Lobar pneumonia is more\ncommon than pleural empyema although pneumonia may later develop into a\npleural empyema. Empyema describes pus in a cavity. Pleural empyema\ndescribes pus in the pleural space. It starts off with pneumonia that is\ncomplicated by an inflammatory response leading to parapneumonic effusion.\nWhen secondary infection of this effusion occurs, it produces an empyema.\nPneumonia – Parapneumonic effusion – Pleural empyema\nPneumona and empyema share similar clinical features however symptoms of\nempyema usually include swinging fevers, night sweats, weight loss and chest\npain. One should suspect pleural empyema if pneumonia does not improve with\nantibiotics.\nDullness to percussion, crackles on auscultation and decreased breath sounds\nare features of lung consolidationfrom pneumonia and can also be seen once an\nempyema develops so they are not a useful discriminating physical finding.",

It is a complication of pneumonia, as well as invasive\nprocedures of the thorax.\nIf an empyema is confirmed (pH of the pleural aspirate < 7.2) or the effusion is\ncausing respiratory compromise then a chest drain should be inserted. The\naspirate should be sent for microscopy and culture\nBlood and sputum cultures shouldalso be repeated, however these are not the\nmost important investigations. The patient will be managed as an inpatient and\ntreated with intravenous antibiotics. Note a HIV test should be requested.\nThe CURB-65 score has also been mentioned in this question. It is wroth\nknowing that the score is a predictor of 30 daymortality for community-acquired\npneumonia and ranges from a score of 0 to 5. It is made up of:\nConfuision (AMTS < 8/10)\nUrea (> 7 mmol/L)\nRespiratory rate (≥ 30 bpm)\n≥ 65 years\nScores of 0-2 can be managed as an outpatient if the patient is well.",

The new 2016 BTS/SIGN guidelines for asthma has dropped the\nsteps however it is stil useful to remember it in steps for the purpose of the exam.\nStep 1\nInhaled short-acting B2 agonist as required\nStep 2\nAdd inhaled steroid at 200-800 mcg/day. 400 mcg/day is a appropriate starting\ndose for many patients\nStep 3\nAdd inhaled long-acting B2 agonist (LABA)\nThen assess control of asthma:\n- If good response to LABA, then continue current management\n- If benefit from LABA but control still inadequate then continue LABA and\nincrease inhaled corticosteroid dose to 800 micrograms/day\n- If no response to LABA, stop LABA and increase inhaled corticosteroid to 800\nmicrograms/day. And If control still inadequate, institute trial of other therapies,\nleukotriene receptor antagonist or SR theophylline\nStep 4\nConsider trials of:\n- increasing inhaled steroid up to 2000 mcg/day\n- adition of a fourth drug e.g. Leukotriene receptor antagonist, SR theophylline,\nB2 agonist tablet\nStep 5\n- Use daily steroid tablets\nReferral to a respiratory physician would be normal at Step 4-5 depending on\nexpertise.\nIf you find this stepwise approach too complicated to memorize.

The occupation as a\nfarmer is also another hint.\nChest X ray: in the acute form may be normal in some or show diffuse\nmicronodular interstitial shadowing like in this case.\nExtrinsic allergic alveolitis\nIn extrinsic allergic alveolitis there is diffuse, granulomatous inflammation of the\nlung parenchyma and airways in people who have been sensitised by repeated\ninhalation of organic antigens in dusts (eg, from dairy or grain products, animal\ndander and protein and water reservoir vapourisers)\nOne of the specific risk factors is occupations including farmers, cattle workers,\nventilation system workers, vets, people working with grain and flour, those\nwhose job involves working with chemicals\nThere are 3 forms of extrinsic allergic alveolitis:\n1. Acute\n2. Subacute\n3. Chronic\nThe most commonly asked form in PLAB is the acute form and so we would only\ndiscuss the acute form of extrinsic allergic alveolitis\nAcute form\n- Symptoms usually start 4-8 hours after exposure to the sensitising antigen and\nresolve quickly, usually within days.\n- There is a flu-like illness with fever, chest tightness, dry cough and dyspnoea.\nAssociated symptoms include malaise, chills, headache, generalised aches and\npains. Wheeze is sometimes present.\n- Signs include fever, tachypnoea and bibasal fine inspiratory crackles",

As this is an\nearly complication (hours rather than days), it is likely to be either atelectasis or\npulmonary embolism. But since there are no other factors pointing towards a\npulmonary embolism and there is a smoking history, the more likely diagnosis\nhere would be atelectasis.\nBasal atelectasis is commoner in smokers and following abdominal or trans-\nthoracic procedures.\nNote that a D-dimer level is unhelpful, as it will be raised by many different intra-\nand post-operative mechanisms. So D-dimers in this scenario would not help you\ndifferentiate pulmonary embolism from atelectasis.

His oxygen saturation was 81% on air, his pulse was 90\nbeats/minute and his blood pressure was recorded at 110/75 mmHg. He\nwas given nebulised salbutamol and thereafter, his oxygen saturation and\nsymptoms improved. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was\nsuspected and he was asked to come back another time to perform a\nspirometry. The spirometry performed on this patient showed a decreased\nFEV1.

In addition, there is an increase in total lung capacity\n(TLC), an increase in functional residual capacity (FRC), and an increase in\nresidual volume (RV). There is often a decrease in vital capacity (VC).\nNote: The reason that this patient was asked to come back another time to\nperform spirometry is it should only be tested when the patient’s condition is\nstable which is ideally six weeks since the last exacerbation.",

Doxycycline is given as 200 mg PO STAT on the first day and\nthen 100 mg PO OD for the next six days in moderate-to-severe community\nacquired pneumonia.\nClarithromycin is contraindicated with the use of a stain as clarithromycin is\npredicted to increase the exposure of the patient to statins which can cause\nrhabdomyolysis. In real life, the best thing to do would be to pause the statin (or\ndecrease the dose) for the duration of the antibiotic therapy with the macrolide\nand then re-commence the statin once the seven days of the antibiotic therapy\nhas been given but since the stem does not have this option, the safest drug to\ngive in this patient is doxycycline. In additin to being contraindicated with statins,\nit also needs to be used in caution with salbutamol as it can cause hypokalaemia.\nCo-amoxiclave is amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. You should not give a penicillin\nbased drug in a penicillin allergic patient.\nCiprofloxacin is rarely given in community acquired pneumonias except in rare\noccasions of atypical pneumonias.\nCephalosporins such as cefuroxime should not be used in patients with a\nhypersensitivity to penicillin because around 10% percentage of patietns who are\nallergic to penicillin are also allergic to cephalosporins.\nAntibiotic policies differ between Trusts.

  "answer": "Administer 24% oxygen",
  "explanation": "This patient is experiencing an exacerbation of COPD. Giving oxygen would be\nthe first action.\nThe history of COPD alone should prompt you to pick 24% oxygen instead of\n100% oxygen. This is because 100% oxygen will abolish the hypoxic drive and\nworsen hypercapnia. 24-28% oxygen significantly increases haemoglobin\nsaturation, without risking further underventilation and a rising pCO2, which can\ncause coma and death. Remember that low-concentration oxygen (of 24-28%) is\nused in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or any other\nconditions causing underventilation and CO2 retention.\nThe aim of (controlled) oxygen therapy is to raise the PaO2 without worsening\nthe acidosis. Therefore, give oxygen at no more than 28% (via venturi mask, 4\nL/minute) or no more than 2 L/minute (via nasal prongs) and aim for oxygen\nsaturation 88-92% for patients with a history of COPD until arterial blood gases\n(ABGs) have been checked. Titrate up the percentage of oxygen administrered\nwith serial ABG sampling until SaO2 of 88-92%.

  "question": "A 24 year old man presents with acute respiratory distress after being\nstabbed in the back. The trachea is not deviated, but he has engorged\nneck veins and reduced air entry on his right chest.

  "choice_e": "Pleural effusion",
  "answer": "Tension pneumothorax",
  "explanation": "The patient has signs of a tension pneumothorax and requires urgent needle\ncompression.\nSome might argue here this is a haemothorax. The stem states that the neck\nveins are engorged. In haemothorax there is no distension of neck veins or\nraised jugular venous pressure due to the hypovolaemic state. Engorged neck\nveins indicate that the pressure within the right ventricle is high. This is seen in\nboth cardiac tamponade and tension pneumothorax. It is not seen in simple\npneumothorax, pleural effusion and haemothorax.\nAnother reason against haemothorax is that it would be very unlikely that a stab\nwound in the back would involve the heart (which is in the anterior mediastinum)\nAND the right lung.\nThe decisiion between cardiac tamponade and tension pneumothorax is a\ndifficult one.\nDo not be confused by the trachea’s lack of deviation – in real life this is actually\nnot a very sensitive sign! The patient is hypotensive, tachycardic, tachypnoeic\nand very unwell. Reduced entry on his right chest indicates that this is the side\nof the tension pneumothorax (presuming he was stabbed on the right side)\nIt is important to remember Beck’s triad for cardiac tamponade. The patient has\nboth hypotension and engorged neck veins, but the heart sounds have not been\ncommented on (which are usually muffled).",

Tracheal compression refers to any\npressure on the trachea sufficient to cause displacement. This is usually in the\ncontext of an enlarging thyroid mass.

  "choice_c": "Pulmonary oedema",

  "answer": "Pulmonary fibrosis",
  "explanation": "This is a very straightforward question but it does test your knowledge of lung\nfunction testing thoroughly. The pulmonary indices indicate a restrictive lung\ndisease. The only choice that is a restrictive lung disease is pulmonary fibrosis.\nAsthma, bronchiectasis, pulmonary oedema and chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease are all obstructive lung diseases.\nPULMONARY FUNCTION TEST\nTerms:\nTotal lung Capacity (TLC) – this is the amount of air in the lungs after maximal\ninspiration\nResidual Volume (RV) – this is the amount of air that remains in the lungs after\nmaximal expiration\nVital Capacity (VC) – this is the amount of air that is pushed out of the lungs after\nmaximal expiration\nForced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) – this is the amount of air that is\npushed out of the lungs in one second during maximal expiration\nForced Vital Capacity (FVC) – this is the amount of air that is pushed out of the\nlungs after forced maximal expiration\nThe following table illustrates the three main values that you need to know for the\nexam and how each pulmonary index differs between obstructive and restrictive\nprocesses\nObstructive Restrictive\nFEV1 ↓ ↓\nLess than 80% of Less than 80% of\npredicted predicted\nFVC N ↓\nMore than 80% of Less than 80% of\npredicted predicted\nFEV1/FVC ↓ N\nLess than 0.7 0.7-0.8\nOR\n↑\nMore than 0.8\nObstructive lung diseases\nThese are diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. They\ncause airway resistance to expiratory flow and so result in obstructed airways.\nWhen expiratory flow is obstructed, the patient will struggle to breathe air out and\nthus FEV1 will decrease. Because FEV1 is the numerator of the FEV1/FVC\nratio, any obstructive disease will also cause a decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio.\nRestrictive lung diseases\nThese are diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease. They\nmay also be caused by obesity, chest or spine deformities and neuromuscular\ndisorders. Restrictive lung diseases restrict lung expansion and cause a\ndecrease in the amount of air that the lung can hold i.e., a decrease in the vital\ncapacity of the lung. This results in a decreased FVC. Because the pathology of\nrestrictive lung diseases also causes a decrease in lung elasticity, it also\nbecomes harder for the lungs to force out air. This causes a decrease in the\nFEV1. Because both the FEV1 and FVC decrease in restrictive lung disease, the\nFEV1/FVC ratio remains the same.",

  "answer": "Discharge with oral clarithromycin",
  "explanation": "Amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav are a class of penicillins and should not be given to\npenicillin allergic patients. Cefuroxime (and all cephalosporins) has a cross\nreactivity of around 10% to penicillins. This means 1 in 10 patients with a\npenicillin allergy, would develop the allergy if taking a cephalosporin. These\noptions can be crossed out almost immediately with the history of a severe\npenicillin allergy.\nThe next step is to calculate the CURB-65 score to assess the need for hospital\nadmission. The CURB-65 is a clinical prediction rule that helps predict mortality\nin patients with community-acquired pneumonia. It consists of 5 risk factors –\neach scoring one point:\n• Confusion of new onset (AMTS of 8 or less)\n• Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L)\n• Respiratory rate ≥ 4- breaths/minute\n• Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg\n• Age ≥ 65\nThe choice of antibiotic to prescribe depends on the severity of the illness. The\npatient scores 0 on his CURB-65 score and thus can be managed at home.\nIf CURB-65 score = 0\n• Prescribe amoxicillin\n• If penicillin allergy, prescribe doxycycline or clarithromycin (other macrolides\nlike erythromycin can also be used)\nIf CURB-65 score = 1 or 2\n• Dual therapy with amoxicillin and clarithromycin or monotherapy with\ndoxycycline\n• Hospital admission can also be considered for patients who score 2 on their\nCURB-65 score\nIf CURB-65 score = 3\n• Arrange hospital admission usually for IV antibiotics",

They are to be continued until 1 to 2 days after the attack has been\nresolved.\nBoth NSAIDs and colchicine re considered first line management in acute gout attacks\nwhich makes this question very difficult to answer. NSAIDs is generally more often\nprescribed in primary practice for gout and is more tolerable since colchicine is known\nfor its side effects which include diarrhoea and nausea. So in the exam, if you were\ngiven the choice between the two and the patient is a young adult with no history of\ngastritis or asthma, pick NSAIDs.\nAlways keep in mind that NSAIDs may exacerbate asthma and may worsen gastritis.\nThey should also not be used in patients with renal insufficiency. Proton pump\ninhibitors are often prescribed together with NSAIDs for gastric protection especially in\nthe elderly where use of NSAIDs should be with caution.\nAllopurinol is used to prevent recurrence of gout and it is not used to treat acute gout.\nCorticosteroids do have a role in gout that does not respond to NSAIDs or colchicine.\nThey can be given as a 5 day course of oral tablets, injected into the joint or injected\nintramuscularly.\nAlthough it is an NSAID, aspirin is not part of the management for gout as it may\nincrease levels of serum uric acid.\nGout\nGout is a disease that affects middle-aged men and presents most commonly with\nacutemonoarthritis.\nThe metatarsophalangeal joint of the first toe is commonly affected (podagra), butother\njoints like the knee, ankle, PIPs, or DIPs may be initially involved. The first\nepisodecommonly occurs at night with severe joint pain waking the patient from sleep.\nThejoint rapidly becomes warm, red, and tender (it looks exactly like cellulitis).\nWithouttreatment the joint pain goes away spontaneously in 2 weeks.\nCertain events that precipitate gout sometimes precede the attack. Question writersvery\ncommonly give a scenario where a person has consumed excessive amounts ofalcohol\nor started taking diuretics such as thiazide diuretics or furosemide.\nDiagnosis\n• Diagnosis is made by the analysis of synovial fluid\n• Serum uric acid during the acute attack may be normal or low.\no Remember this it is common that questions ask for the diagnostic method for\nacute gout – serum uric acid should never be the answer for those questions.\no Serum uric acid level is of no value in the diagnosis of acute urate arthropathy.\no Uric acid should only be performed 4 to 6 weeks after the acute gout.\nTreatment:\nAcute management\n- NSAIDs\n- intra-articular steroid injection\n- Colchicine\nChronic hypouricemic therapy:\n- Allopurinol should not be started until 2 weeks after an acute attack has settledas it\nmay precipitate a further attack if started too early\n- NSAID or colchicine cover should be used when starting allopurinol",

Also,\ninpolymyalgia rheumatica, creatinine kinase would not be raised. One of the criteria\nforthe diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica is having an ESR >30 mm/h or CRP >6\nmg/mLof which we do not see in this stem. Hence, the best answer here is polymyositis.\nPolymyositis\nClinical Findings\n- First presents with difficulty with tasks that involve the proximal muscles:lifting objects,\ncombing hair, getting up from the chair.\n- The weakness is usually symmetric and diffuse, involving the proximal musclesof the\nneck, shoulders, trunk, hips, and thighs, the lower limb muscles tendingto be clinically\nsymptomatic first.\n- Fatigue, myalgia and muscle cramps may also be present.\nInvestigation:\n• Elevation of creatine kinase.\n• Aldolase levels may also be raised.\n• Autoantibodies:\no Anti-Jo-1 antibodies. Note that these are more common in patients with\npolymyositis than in patients with dermatomyositis.\n• Muscle biopsy can be diagnostic.\nTreatment\n- Involves steroids",

  "answer": "ESR",
  "explanation": "Temporal arteritis (TA) is the suspected diagnosis here. Erythrocyte sedimentation\ntest(ESR) is the first test to do in patients suspected to have TA. Since the question ask\nforthe most appropriate “initial” investigation, the answer would be ESR. If the\nquestionhad asked for the most appropriate “definitive” investigation, the temporal\narterybiopsy would be the answer.\nTA (Temporal Arteritis)\nTA (Temporal Arteritis), also known as giant cell arteritis, is a vasculitis affecting\nthelarge arteries that supply the head, eyes, and optic nerves. New-onset headache in\nanypatient older than 50 years prompts consideration of this diagnosis, which if\nleftuntreated may result in permanent vision loss.\nThe most common symptoms of giant cell arteritis are headache and pain that\nusuallyoccurs in one or both temples. Other common symptoms include: scalp\ntenderness(pain when combing hair, jaw claudication (jaw pain when chewing),\ndecreased visionor blurry vision, tongue numbness, or, rarely, sudden loss of vision.\nSometimes thepatient may have proximal stiffness (neck, arms, hips) due to\npolymyalgia rheumatica, acoexisting condition with TA.\nThe erythrocyte sedimentation test (ESR) is the first test to do in patients suspected\ntohave TA.\nThe diagnosis is always confirmed by biopsy of the temporal arteries in which\nthecharacteristic giant cells are demonstrated. In the patient whom you suspect to\nhaveTA, if the ESR is elevated, corticosteroids should be started immediately, before\nthe temporal artery biopsy is performed.\nOccasionally they may ask which medication can be added onto corticosterids for\ntreatment of GCA. Add on low-dose aspirin. Aspirin 75 mg daily has been shown to\ndecrease the rate of visual loss and strokes in patients with GCA.",

Other\ncommon thiazidesdiuretics to be aware of include Indapamide, Chlorthalidone and\nMetolazone.\nAlthough a raised serum uric acid level is an important risk factor for gout, the use\nofserum uric acid as a diagnostic test is limited.

A\nthiazidediuretic may be added to a loop diuretic in the case of severe cardiac failure. We\ndo notknow what type of diuretic this man has been put on but it is highly probable that\nhewas put on a thiazide diuretic.\nIn order to diagnose gout, we MUST do a joint aspirate. Since there was no mention\nofthis man having a fever, there is no need to do a joint aspirate culture. Joint\nmicroscopywould be ideal since we would be able to visualise the MSU crystals of gout.\nYou may sometimes see a raised serum uric acid level in acute gout, however not\nallpeople suffering from gout demonstrate raised serum uric acid levels and this is not\nanaccurate test to diagnose the condition.\nKeep in mind that when the stem says “single best method for confirming thediagnosis”,\nit is always a biopsy (or the equivalent of an invasive diagnostic test).\nThiazide Diuretics\nMost common types of thiazide diuretics in use: bendroflumethiazide,\nchlorthalidone,cyclopenthiazide, indapamide, metolazone, and xipamideCommon or\nserious possible side-effects include:\n- Hyperglycaemia\n- Increase in uric acid levels\n- Hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypercalcaemia.\n- Other problems, such as:\no GI upset\no Postural hypotension\no Impotence\no Skin sensitivity to sunlight",

  "explanation": "This is not a clear cut question and the most likely diagnosis here is limited\nsystemicsclerosis.\nBoth limited and diffuse systemic sclerosis may present with pain in hands\nwhenexposed to cold (Raynaud's phenomena). The classical features of\nRaynaud'sphenomenon are episodic pallor of the digits due to ischaemia, followed by\ncyanosisdue to deoxygenation and then followed by redness with pain and tingling\nwhich iswhen there is reperfusion.\nThe presence of the pink and red dots on the lips and tips of fingers\nrepresenttelangiectasia which is seen as part of the CREST syndrome in limited\nsystemic sclerosis.These are visibly dilated blood vessels that usually appear on the\nfingers, palms, face,lips and chest.\nArthralgia is usually seen more in diffuse systemic sclerosis which goes against\ntheanswer of limited systemic sclerosis. In limited systemic sclerosis, the complaint\nisusually the occasional joint stiffness rather than arthralgia. However, given the\nslowprogression of the disease and no other features of organ involvement,\nlimitedsystemic sclerosis is likely the answer.\nRheumatoid arthritis is also a potential differential because it is another cause\nofRaynaud's phenomenon and would explain the symmetrical peripheral\narthropathy.Nonetheless, rheumatoid arthritis is a rare cause of Raynaud’s\nphenomenon and aneven rarer cause of telangiectasia.\nGiven the stem, the best answer still remains as limited systemic sclerosis\nLIMITED SCLERODERMA VS DIFFUSE SCLERODERMA\nLimited Scleroderma – Diffuse Scleroderma\nCREST Syndrome\nSkin involvement Limited areas of skin are thick; More areas of the skin are\nusually just the fingers and/or involved and thickened.\nface.

Later findings once there is significant chronic\nspine inflammation include a “bamboo spine” and squaring of the vertebral bodies.\nESR levels correlate with disease activity and is a good blood test to order when\nthinking about ankylosing spondylitis but an X-ray is still a better test to perform to\ndiagnose ankylosing spondylitis.\nHLA B27 should not be used to diagnose ankylosing spondylitis.\nMRI scanning has a growing role in diagnosis and prognostication.

  "explanation": "Seronegative spondyloarthropathy (or seronegative spondyloarthritis) is a group\nofdiseases involving the axial skeleton. The term “seronegative” refers to the fact\nthatthese diseases are negative for rheumatoid factor. This indicates that there is\nadifferent pathophysiological mechanism of disease when comparing with\nrheumatoidarthritis.\nAnkylosing spondylitis is one of the seronegative spondyloarthropathies and it is\nseenhere in this stem. The lower back pain and stiffness are consistent with\nankylosingspondylitis. He is around the correct age to develop ankylosing spondylitis as\nwell.Ankylosing spondylitis usually occurs before the age of 30 years.\nThe eye manifestations are consistent with acute anterior uveitis which occurs in 20-\n30% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Of all patients presenting with acuteanterior\nuveitis, a third to a half have or will go on to develop ankylosing spondylitis.\nThe chronic diarrhoea, aphthous ulcers and perianal skin tags are consistent\nwithCrohn's disease. You need to remember that there is an increased incidence\nofankylosing spondylitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\nAnkylosingspondylitis is around 10 - 20 times more common in patients with IBD than it\nwould beseen in the general population.\nThe blood results are also consistent with ankylosing spondylitis.\n- Normochromic normocytic anaemia of chronic disease\n- Elevated ESR and CRP level correlating to disease activity",

Remember:\nIn testicular torsion, lifting the testis up over the symphysis increases pain,\nwhereas in epididymitis this usually relieves pain.\n• Urgent surgery is indicated\nManagement:\n• Urgent exploratory surgery is needed to prevent ischaemia of the testicle\nColour Doppler USS (reduced arterial blood flow in the testicular artery) and\nradionuclide scanning (decreased radioisotope uptake) can be used to diagnose\ntesticular torsion, but in many hospitals, these tests are not readily available and\nthe diagnosis is based on symptoms and signs. Scrotal exploration should be\nundertaken as a matter of urgency. Delay in relieving the twisted testis results in\npermanent ischaemic damage to the testis, causing atrophy.\nThis is a very high yield question and in most cases if you suspect testicular\ntorsion the answer would be exploratory surgery (or urgent surgery).\nREMEMBER: if clinical suspicion is high, surgical intervention should not be\ndelayed for the sake of further investigation!",

  "answer": "Epididymo-orchitis",
  "explanation": "The history here is of epididymo-orchitis. The two major things you need to look\nout for when someone presents with testicular/scrotal pain is epididymo-orchitis\nand testicular torsion. Epididymo-orchitis would have a more gradual onset of\nsymptoms like in this case. It is quite clear that this is actually epididymo-orchitis\nespecially with the gradual onset and the fever.\nRemember, dysuria is also a symptom of acute epididymo-orchitis although not\nvery frequently seen.\nEpididymo-orchitis\nEpididymo-orchitis describes an infection of the epididymis with or without an\ninfection of the testes resulting in pain and swelling. It is most commonly caused\nby local spread of infections from the genital tract (such as Chlamydia\ntrachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae) where there is a retrograde spread from\nthe prostatic urethra and seminal vesicles.\nThe most important differential diagnosis is testicular torsion. This needs to be\nexcluded urgently to prevent ischaemia of the testicle. Epididymo-orchitis has\nsimilar presenting symptoms as testicular torsion. Tenderness is usually localized\nto the epididymis (absence of testicular tenderness may help to distinguish\nepididymo-orchitis from testicular torsion, but in many cases, it is difficult to\ndistinguish between the two).\nAnother feature that can help distinguish epididymo-orchitis from testicular\ntorsion is that the tenderness may be relieved by elevating the scrotum (positive\nPrehn’s sign) in epididymo-orchitis. Whereas this same action would exacerbate\npain or show no relief in pain if one had a testicular torsion (negative Prehn’s\nsign)\nFeatures\n• unilateral testicular pain and swelling\n• urethral discharge may be present, but urethritis is often asymptomatic\n• factors suggesting testicular torsion include patients < 20 years, severe pain\nand an acute onset\nManagement\n• Antibiotics.\nIn PLAB part 1, it is unlikely you would need to know which type of antibiotics to\ntreat epididymo-orchitis.\nNote: One important differential is testicular torsion. Look out for factors\nsuggestive of testicular torsion which includes patients under the age of 20 years\nhaving severe testicular pain and an acute onset.",

  "choice_e": "CA 129-9",
  "answer": "Lactate dehydrogenase",
  "explanation": "Being born with unilateral or bilateral undescended testicles (cryptorchidism)\nincreases the risk of testicular cancer (particularly seminomas) by up to 10 times\nhigher than that in the general population. The most common type of testicular\ncancer occuring in undescended testes is seminoma (a type of germ cell\ntumour).\nThe management of an undescended testicle is usually a surgical orchiopexy,\nperforemd at 6 months of age.\nThe symptoms of shortness of breath experienced by the patient is secondary to\nmetastases, presumably from a testicular cancer.\nWhilst tumour markers such as beta-HCG, AFP and LDH are an indicator of\ndisease activity and would be requested in a clinical setting, the question here\nspecifically asks which of them is likely to be elevated. As the likely diagnosis\nhere is a seminoma, LDH is most likely to be elevated. In some seminomas,\nLDH may be the only tumour marker seen to be elevated.\nTesticular cancer\n- Majority of testicular tumours arise from the germ cells.\nTesticular germ cell tumours can be subdivided into seminoma and\nnonseminomatous germ cell tumours however this is unlikely a need to know for\nthis exam. The presentation is the more important information to remember.\nPresentation\n• Painless lump in the body of the testis → This is the most common\npresentation\nDiagnosis\n• Ultrasound is first line → This should be first line for any scrotal lump\n• CT scan is used for staging\n• Appropriate tumour markers should be ordered\nSecondary spread is to the para-aortic lymph nodes rather than the inguinal\nlymph nodes. Metastases to the testis are rare however if they did occur, the\nmost common location of metastases is the prostate and the second most\ncommon location is the lung.",

The common iliac bifurcates into internal and\nexternal iliac arteries and since there is no mention of symptoms of internal iliac artery\nobstruction in the stem, an external iliac artery occlusion would actually be the best\noption if it was given in the exam.

Sometimes PLAB questions would also give a difference in blood\npressure in limbson the right and left side of the body.\nThoracic Aortic Dissection - Dissecting aneurysm of the thoracic aorta:\nOccurs in the poorly controlled hypertensive. The episode resembles an Ml, with\nsuddenonset of extremely severe, tearing chest pain that radiates to the back and\nmigrates downshortly after its onset.\nThere may be unequal pulses in the upper extremities, and x-rayshows a wide\nmediastinum. ECG and cardiac enzymes rule out Ml. Definitive diagnosisshould be\nsought by noninvasive means (to avoid high-pressure injection needed for\ntheaortogram). MRI angiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram have been used,\nbut thebest option is probably a spiral CT scan.\nAs a rule (riddled with exceptions), dissections of theascending aorta are treated\nsurgically, whereas those in the descending are managedmedically with control of the\nhypertension in the ICU.\nStanford classification\nType A\n• ascending aorta, 2/3 of cases\n• surgical management, but blood pressure should be controlled to a target systolic of\n100-120 mmHg whilst awaiting intervention\nType B\n• descending aorta, distal to left subclavian origin, 1/3 of cases\n• conservative management\n• bed rest\n• reduce blood pressure IV labetalol to prevent progression\nDeBakey classification\nType I\n• originates in ascending aorta, propagates to at least the aortic arch and possibly\nbeyond it distally\nType II\n• originates in and is confined to the ascending aorta\nType III\n• originates in descending aorta, rarely extends proximally but will extend distally\nRisk factors\n• Approximately 50-75% of patients with dissection will have evidence of\nhypertension or a previous diagnosis\n• Other risk factors include smoking and raised cholesterol. The most common risk\nfactor is hypertension\n• Inherited risks include Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and familial\nthoracic aortic aneurysm\nRemember: The most common risk factor is hypertension",
